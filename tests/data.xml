	<title>A Theater Serves as a Courthouse, Provoking Drama Offstage</title>
	<author>Alex Marshall</author>
	<body>BIRMINGHAM, England — One recent Monday, Sarah Buckingham walked into an auditorium at Birmingham Repertory Theater, strode up some steps to a platform and looked out at her audience. She was in full costume, with a wig, and everyone rose to their feet.It might seem like a star’s entrance, but Ms. Buckingham is not an actress; she is a judge, overseeing a criminal trial.Three national lockdowns in Britain, as well as tough social distancing guidelines, have hampered the business of England’s court system this past year, creating a huge backlog of cases. Since July, the country’s courts service has been renting suitable spaces — like theaters, but also conference centers and local government buildings  — then turning them into temporary courtrooms.“I believe a large number of you are familiar with this building for reasons unrelated to crime,” Ms. Buckingham told the jury, before the case began. About 30 feet away from her stood Rzgar Mohammad, 34, a delivery driver who was accused of smashing a glass hookah pipe against another man’s head, then hitting him repeatedly with a pole. He was pleading not guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.Britain’s theaters have been in financial crisis since the coronavirus pandemic forced them to shut last March. Although a few have hosted performances for socially distanced audiences, most have only survived through a combination of crisis grants and layoffs. Given that, the Birmingham theater’s decision to lease space to the courts service is perhaps unsurprising. Another theater, in the Lowry arts complex in Manchester, has been hosting trials since October. But the move has angered theatermakers in Birmingham, Britain’s second largest city, who claim the courts and the police have historically targeted communities of color, and that theaters should be kept as spaces for creativity. Jay Crutchley, a Black director, said in a telephone interview that the Rep — as the theater is known in Birmingham — had “just endorsed probably the biggest systematic oppressor of Black people in this country.” Young Black men are disproportionately represented in Britain’s prisons, he added, and many people growing up in Birmingham — white and Black — have bad experiences with the police. “I’ve had close friends go through the court system,” he said, “and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been stopped and searched.” The Rep’s decision to host a court was turning the theater into a potential site of trauma, Mr. Crutchley added. “There’s a line for me where ethics gets in the way of money,” he said. On Monday, the theater announced two online meetings to listen to the feedback of anyone concerned about its decision. “We are committed to hearing your thoughts directly,” it said.Birmingham is one of Britain’s most diverse cities — at the time of the last census, in 2011, more than a quarter of its population was Asian, and around 9 percent was Black — and the Rep has long been praised for its efforts to engage people of color.  Its latest season would have included several plays by people of color, if coronavirus had not forced its closure. Those included the premiere of Lolita Chakrabarti’s “Calmer,” directed by the Black actor Adrian Lester. Mr. Lester is a trustee of the Birmingham Rep’s board and is also married to Ms. Chakrabarti.But just days after the Dec. 14 announcement that the playhouse would be used to hear trials, Talawa — a leading Black theater company — canceled a scheduled season of plays at the Rep on the theme of “Black joy.” The Rep’s move “does not align with Talawa’s commitment to Black artists and communities,” the company said in a news release. (A spokeswoman for Talawa declined to an interview request for this article.)The organizers of More Than a Moment, a Birmingham-based cultural initiative aimed at promoting Black artists, also removed the Rep from its guiding committee.The theater, whose spokesman declined an interview request, said in a blog post that the deal with the courts was needed to secure its financial future. Yet Rico Johnson-Sinclair, the manager of SHOUT, an L.G.B.T. arts festival that holds events at the Rep, said in a telephone interview that the Rep was not in immediate danger and had money to keep running until April. In October, Britain’s culture ministry gave the Rep £1.3 million, about $1.8 million.“If they’d been transparent and said, ‘We need to do this or we’re going to go under and they’ll be no more Birmingham Rep,’ I think the Black community would have been more forgiving,” Mr. Johnson-Sinclair said. “But I still don’t think it’s the right course of action.”In interviews outside the theater, six Black passers-by expressed divergent views about the situation. Three said they understood the complaints, but were supportive of the theater becoming a court. “What else can they do to survive?” said Elliot Myers, 30, the owner of a marketing agency. “Needs must,” he added. But three were opposed. “I know they’re desperate for money, but surely we can find another way?” said David Foster, 47, a street cleaner. Philip Morris, 37, a barber said, “You don’t want to be going to the theater thinking, ‘Court system.’” He added that the theater would be “just more for the European white now.”In the makeshift courtroom on Monday, the proceedings did sometimes have the air of a theatrical courtroom drama. Mr. Brotherton, the prosecution’s lawyer, outlined his case, then showed the jury a video capturing part of the incident. Everyone paid rapt attention. But in real life, trials unfold at a less than gripping pace. Just as things were getting exciting, the judge stopped the proceedings  for lunch and so clerks could find an interpreter for one of the witnesses. But when everyone returned to the auditorium, the interpreter was still nowhere to be seen. The lawyers spoke among themselves, marveling at the lighting rig above.After another 50 minutes, the interpreter still hadn’t arrived, unable to find the theater. It was the type of event that delays many court proceedings in Britain, even outside a pandemic.“All right, I’ll admit defeat,” Judge Buckingham said after learning the news. She called the jury back into the room, and sent them home for the day. The 12 men and women shuffled out, stage right, but with little sense of drama or spectacle. </body>

	<title>The Devilish Life and Art of Lucian Freud, in Full Detail</title>
	<author>Dwight Garner</author>
	<body>The critic Kenneth Tynan divided playwrights into two categories, “smooth” and “hairy,” and one could probably make a similar distinction among biographers. Smooth biographers offer clean narrative lines, well-underscored themes, and carrots, in the form of cliffhangers, to lure the reader onward. Their books are on best-seller lists. They’re good gifts for Dad.William Feaver, the author of “The Lives of Lucian Freud” — the second volume, “Fame, 1968-2011,” is out now — exists on the opposite extreme. There’s little smoothness in him at all. His biography is hairier than a bonobo.Feaver, a longtime art critic for The Observer in London, doesn’t provide a fixed portrait of Freud, the great realist painter, so much as he leads us into a studio filled with crusty brushes, scrapers, half-completed canvases, easels, dirty floorboards, mahlsticks and distilled turpentine, and lets us poke through the detritus as if to assemble a likeness for ourselves.Some critics have found the jumbled, unmediated quality of these biographies to be a feature rather than a bug. I’ve tried to see it that way. Reading these talky and cluttered books is like scrolling through microfilm: There are no grand vistas, but there are neck aches and, often enough, because Freud led life up to the nostrils, fantastic “aha!” moments.[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of January. See the full list. ]A grandson of Sigmund Freud, Lucian was born in Berlin in 1922. His father was an architect. Lucian’s family fled to England in 1933, not long after the Nazis seized power. He was born with an extra toe on his small toe, which the family, to his disappointment, had removed. He later grew a sharklike fang, he claimed, between his front teeth. That was tugged out as well.Freud served briefly in World War II as an ordinary seaman. He became a painter, Feaver writes, because “he used to go around saying he was a painter” and “after a time he had to do something about it.” Then began a career in art and social climbing. His second wife was Caroline Blackwood, heir to the Guinness fortune.Sitting for one of Lucian’s portraits was not so unlike sitting on Sigmund’s couch. Sessions went on for months, if not years. One difference was that Lucian’s visitants usually took off their clothes.Lucian and his furious id would have made an interesting case study for his grandfather. The artist was amoral: violent, selfish, vindictive, lecherous. He lived like a puddle-stomping toddler. If he was not the devil, he was certainly the devil’s advocate.Freud needed new lovers the way a diabetic needs insulin. He trolled for young women to paint and sleep with, but he hardly needed to. They came to him. He was handsome and a genius and offered, as one of his lovers put it, the lure of studio life, “champagne there on dirty floorboards.” To be painted by Freud was, increasingly, a shot at cultural permanence.Freud painted slowly, by accretion. Feaver’s life of Freud is compiled similarly. The author, a gifted critic, knew Freud well during the last decades of his life, and they talked frequently on the telephone. It’s possible Feaver had too much access to his subject. He quotes Freud too freely, and at too great a length, on nearly every topic.The reader nods when Freud comments, deep into Volume Two: “A lot of the things I say have got a semi-incomprehensible side.” You wish you could cover him, like a parrot, when you want him to be silent.“Fame, 1968-2011” finds Freud finally receiving major exhibitions; the prices of his paintings soared. Feaver details Freud’s relationship with his great friend-foe Francis Bacon. They went tit-for-tat in terms of eccentricity.Freud only rarely painted celebrities, but he did make portraits of the queen and of Kate Moss. (Feaver doesn’t mention the tattoo that Freud gave Moss: two tiny swallows at the base of her spine.) When the model Jerry Hall missed a few sittings, Freud painted her out of a portrait. He was an outlandish gambler. “Gambling must be all-out,” he said. “It must alter the balance of life.” He once paid off a debt by painting a bookie.Freud was not a family man. He was not close to his brothers (they are barely mentioned in Volume Two), but he did paint a series of portraits of his mother, over more than a thousand four-hour sittings. Feaver calls those sessions “arguably the longest time ever spent by any mother’s painter son on any painter son’s mother.”Family does intrude as Freud’s children, legitimate and illegitimate, begin to crawl from the woodwork. He had at least 14 offspring he acknowledged as his own. He called himself “one of the great absentee fathers of the age.” Soon there are grandchildren as well. Freud did not do much hugging, but his progeny could tap him for money.Many got to know him by sitting for portraits. He painted his daughters naked. “They make it all right for me to paint them,” he said. “My naked daughters have nothing to be ashamed of.”Freud had a mean word for everyone. He put the knife in white and it came out red. A typical comment in this volume, about an aunt, is: “She was very nasty really, in a small sort of way. Her expertise was opening letters. Other people’s.” If he didn’t like you, he cut you from his life like cancer. You can always tell a monster: He wears scarves indoors.He had a mighty work ethic, and he turned out paintings until nearly the end. He lived in the imperative tense and barely slowed down. He stood in the center of his own self-importance. There wasn’t a big gap, as there is in most lives, between being carefree and being carrion.Can one pick up Volume Two of this biography if one hasn’t read Volume One? Feaver seems to suggest the answer is no. He doesn’t always bother to reintroduce people or topics. When “Clement” suddenly appears in Volume Two, with no surname attached, will every reader know this is Clement Freud, Lucian’s estranged brother?Perhaps it doesn’t matter. There’s a sense one could skip three or four pages almost anywhere in these books and not miss anything crucial.Everybody has an opinion about Freud’s art, and no one is wrong, exactly. I tend to align myself, as Feaver seems to, with Robert Hughes, who asserted in 1987 that Freud was “the greatest living realist painter.” He made the ordinary gravid, and sublime.</body>

	<title>Paging Through Broadway While the Stages Are Dark</title>
	<author>Maya Phillips</author>
	<body>To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.I admit it: I’m supposed to be packing. I’m starting 2021 with a move, to my first solo apartment, and I was doing pretty well for a while: rolled up the rug, took down some artwork, packed four bins of books without pausing (Flo Rida’s “My House” played on Spotify as an aspirational track). It was the Playbills that got me, the unwieldy stack at the top of the bookcase that leaned sloppily, as though at any moment a handful would slide off and escape to the floor.I never thought of myself as particularly nostalgic. I’m too clutter-averse, I thought, to hold onto things for no reason. (Kondo before it was cool?) And yet, I now realize that I do have my sentimental moments: old New York Comic Con badges hanging on my closet door knob, dated newspaper clips with my byline in a bin, notebooks of shameful teenage and preteen fiction and poetry (though, to be fair, those I’m just too neurotic to throw out, in case some poor soul should lay eyes on them).And I can never get rid of my Playbills — nor can I ever just “grab one” to check a detail without taking a Zipcar down memory lane and resurfacing an hour or so later. They’re like snapshots, capturing the ephemeral, the essential element of live performance that makes it unique and one of my greatest loves: They are souvenirs of a moment that will never happen again.We’re coming up on a year without theater, and though it’s been rough, last spring was the worst, as I crossed off the plays I’d planned to see: “Hangmen,” “Six,” “American Buffalo” and more. I felt restless; I had gotten so used to running to Midtown for a show after work and puttering around Bryant Park on weekends between a matinee and an evening performance. Much of the time I was reviewing for The New Yorker, or freelancing for The Times, so I always carried the Playbills until my work was published. On the morning commute from Brooklyn, I’d flip through a program in response to my editor’s deadline queries to double-check a name or bio. Those Playbills might stay in my bag, only to be rediscovered days later, revealing a weekend of seeing and writing.But I’m being nostalgic again.It’s hard not to be when I haven’t sat in a theater in 10 months, haven’t sprinted down 42nd Street to make a curtain, haven’t settled into the anticipatory silence of a dark theater before the first word is spoken onstage.I’ve kept Playbills since I was a kid. For years I kept movie ticket stubs, too, but they didn’t hold the same allure or capture the grandeur of a Broadway performance. The pile includes my early theater experiences like “Aida,” “The Color Purple” and “The Lion King.” There are Playbills with cast members who later hit the big time; I picked up a program for the Manhattan Theater Club’s production of “Prodigal Son” and recognized a now-familiar face: Timothée Chalamet, pre-“Call Me by Your Name” and “Lady Bird.”There are duplicates for the ones I’ve seen more than once, like “Rent,” and though I’ve debated throwing those out, I never have, knowing that each program represents an experience both the same and different; even if I saw the same cast do the same script, word for word, note for note, something would have inevitably changed.It’s an exquisite tragedy — that every time you see theater, you receive something new, but that gift is immediately chased by a loss. It can’t be replicated. Memory is imperfect. As a critic, I experience productions in a super-heightened state. I try to make sure every detail adheres to my memory — the lights, the movement, the sounds, the scenery. But no matter what, it’s like trying to catch water in my hands. By the time I was heading home, under the punishing lights of an F train car, I’d already feel it slipping, just a little bit, as the world outside the theater poured back into me.In my collection I saw Playbills for shows I only vaguely remembered and ones I didn’t recall at all. I looked at each one and the feeling was something like heartbreak, a tiny dose of grief. I don’t even have programs for every show I’ve seen; some I’ve lost, some I failed to pick up and some, to my dismay, were digital.Years ago the Times critic Walter Kerr wrote about his not keeping Playbills, considering the psychology of the collector, saying it “isn’t a matter of wallowing in nostalgia”; it’s always about looking for the next addition to the collection. I have to disagree. When my friends suggest putting my programs in binders or frames or transforming them into chic Instagrammable décor, I resist, because I’m not the collector Kerr imagined. I do wallow — or I’d say, more accurately, bask — in my memories, and I don’t want those past performances to be displayed like trophies; I want to touch them, as though I could take those moments themselves into my hands. It’s my little act of witchcraft: I thumb through the pages and suddenly it’s resurrected — my feeling at 18, sitting with my aunt in the Richard Rodgers Theater watching “In the Heights.”I know it may sound silly to be so attached to a little promotional booklet — or, in some cases, a single unadorned piece of folded card stock or sheet of printer paper — and imagine it represents mourning when there are many other things to mourn at the moment. And by now I know I’m stalling, am still staring at piles of Playbills on the bed instead of packing plates and mugs. It occurs to me that right now, if it were a normal Sunday a year ago, I’d be leaving for a Sunday matinee.One of the biggest challenges of being a critic is accounting for the art being made in the present but also recalling the past. We bear witness to art, writing about it so people know it is there, that it’s happening, that it happened. But as I’ve already said, memory is flawed, and so are we. We’re always in the process of forgetting some detail or another: last Wednesday’s breakfast, the phone number of a childhood home, the opening number of a musical from 2013, the color of a dress an actress wore onstage just last year. They go one by one.So, I pack up my Playbills for the productions I recall and the ones I don’t. When theater returns, I will accumulate more to shelve with the others and look through them when I’m feeling nostalgic. And I’ll know that even though I may not remember the particulars of every single performance or set, there’s still something precious in the knowledge that for one specific moment in time, something special happened, I saw it, I was there.</body>

	<title>Here's why West Virginia is a leader in the U.S. vaccine rollout.</title>
	<author>Sarah Mervosh</author>
	<body>Carolyn Zain had heard horror stories about the nation’s coronavirus vaccine rollout: long waits, clunky websites, people being turned away. So when her health department announced it was expanding appointments, she armed herself with two phones and held her breath.Within 20 minutes, she secured a slot for the next day. She arrived for her 2 p.m. appointment and was resting in a chair, a fresh shot in her arm, by 2:21 p.m.“It went wonderfully,” said Ms. Zain, 79, who, after a year spent mostly home alone, wore a sequined face mask that shimmered like confetti for her appointment at a Charleston clinic last week.Since the United States began distributing vaccines more than a month ago, it has moved far more slowly than officials had hoped. But West Virginia has stood out for its success in getting people vaccinated. About 9 percent of all West Virginians have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, a larger segment than in every state but Alaska and double the rate of some.No state has given a larger share of its residents second doses, a crucial step to securing the best chance at immunity.While many states are struggling to hand out the shots that the federal government has provided to them, West Virginia has given out 83 percent of its doses, by far among the highest. Many states so far have struggled to give even half of their allotted vaccines.“West Virginia is about at the top of the charts,” said Dr. Mark McClellan, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We need to get more states to the point that they have the vaccination capacity of West Virginia.”The state also provides a glimpse at a fundamental problem that looms for the country: Even the most efficient state vaccine operations do not have enough shots for all who want them.Dr. Clay Marsh, the state coronavirus czar, estimated that West Virginia had the capacity to handle 125,000 doses a week, but was getting just 23,600. Early on, the state got a significant head start because it initially opted out of a federal program to vaccinate people in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.The federal plan teamed up with Walgreens and CVS to inoculate people in nursing homes around the country, but many communities in West Virginia are far from the nearest big box store, and about half of pharmacies are independently owned.West Virginia created a network of pharmacies in the state, pairing them with about 200 long-term care facilities. As a result, West Virginia finished its first round of vaccinations at nursing homes last month, while many states were just getting started.Central to the state’s strategy, too, is putting the National Guard at the helm of vaccine operations.Officials say they have also learned what not to do, including not promising shots they do not yet have. In Charleston, appointments are not made until county officials have that week’s allotment of vaccines on hand, sitting in their own freezer.</body>

	<title>Senator Hawley’s Canceled Book Deal: No First Amendment Issue</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>To the Editor:Re “Twitter Bans and Scrapped Books: Maybe Unwise, but Hardly Illegal” (news article, Jan. 10):After Simon &amp; Schuster announced that it was canceling Senator Josh Hawley’s publishing contract because of his leading role in trying to prevent the formalization of Joe Biden’s election as president, the Republican senator issued a statement calling the action “Orwellian” and a “direct assault on the First Amendment.”Mr. Hawley, a graduate of Yale Law School, must know that his claim is specious: The First Amendment prohibits the government from muzzling speech; private entities, like publishing houses, have no such restraints.When Donald Trump tries to cash in on his disgraced presidency by publishing his memoirs (which undoubtedly will rewrite history beyond recognition and foment further strife), every publishing company in the United States should follow Simon &amp; Schuster’s example.Daniel B. BernsteinSacramentoTo the Editor:Re “On Work: Are You Sure You Want to Go Back to the Office?,” by Anne Helen Petersen (Sunday Review, Dec. 27):When Ms. Petersen states firmly that “people don’t really want to get back to the office,” even when it becomes safe to do so, she is speaking from a position of privilege. Remote working suits people who are established, have power and have a home to work in, but many people simply do not have these advantages.I have worked with students who live in conditions where even doing a piece of homework is impossible at home. How on earth are they meant to enter into a field of work that presumes that they will be able to afford a room, internet, heating and quiet? How can they compete with wealthier colleagues who have all those things?Bullying, too, is easier under remote working conditions: It is easier to over-delegate to people when you can’t actually see them and when you know that they aren’t visible to others. Remote and flexible working, while absolutely necessary during Covid-19 for safety reasons, should not be advocated when it is safe to return on the false argument that it will benefit everyone.Varsha ShahMiddlesex, EnglandTo the Editor:Re “When It’s Time for the Tenants to Go” (front page, Dec. 20), about a Massachusetts sheriff’s attempt to make evictions “respectful and humane”:An eviction can’t be humane if the circumstances around it are inhumane. Since homelessness causes and perpetuates structural poverty, U.S. institutions need to be accountable for housing citizens.I’ve practiced law in Boston housing court for six years, representing vulnerable clients pro bono. Eviction makes it harder to hold or apply for a job, fulfill prescriptions or get mail. The tenant may be barred from Section 8 assistance. Public records document the eviction for future landlords.The full impact is felt even later: in the despair of a mother who can’t feed or house her child, in the anxiety of a former addict fearful of a relapse, in the inevitable hopelessness of marginalization. Shelters provide a bed (when available), but expose the vulnerable to theft, assault and others dealing with mental crises.Sheriff Nicholas Cocchi’s actions are praiseworthy, but housing should not rely on charity or the discretion of local officials. To truly help the most vulnerable, and make evictions humane, housing must be guaranteed to citizens by law.Andre GarronBostonTo the Editor:Please provide more balance in articles regarding eviction. Landlords are not in the business of evicting renters, and we have been working hard without any unemployment benefits or federal or state funding during the Covid pandemic. Yet we are expected to house the public for free. While we understand that many residents have lost their jobs, how do we maintain our properties without income? How do we pay our mortgages, insurance, property taxes, payroll, utilities and repair bills?Most landlords are private citizens working hard to provide and maintain housing. We expect payment in exchange for our services, just as we must pay for essential services like groceries, gasoline and internet. Why is housing different?During this pandemic, most of our renters have been working with us to help them get through this time. But sadly we have some who are taking advantage of the eviction moratorium, continuing to work and refusing to pay rent. We have had one renter attack and beat up another, and we cannot evict the violent renter. We cannot sustain our properties for much longer without financial assistance from the government.Katherine JohansenTustin, Calif.</body>

	<title>Will Biden’s Stimulus Package Help Reverse the ‘Shecession’?</title>
	<author>Alisha Haridasani Gupta</author>
	<body>— C. Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women’s Policy ResearchIn Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday unveiled an economic stimulus package that has been praised — even by conservative-leaning businesses, lobbying groups and analysts — for its size and scope, matching the current economic crisis with a historically unique response.“Not since the New Deal during the Great Depression have we seen such an ambitious economic stimulus plan,” said C. Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “What that signals to me is that the new administration understands the magnitude of the problem.”From the get go, this economic crisis has been markedly different from previous ones: It wasn’t caused by geopolitical or financial forces, and it disproportionately affected women.A bulk of the jobs that vanished at the start of the coronavirus pandemic were held by women — particularly women of color — who worked in service industries like hospitality, travel, retail and entertainment.The downward trend held through the year, with more than 800,000 women dropping out of the work force completely in September (no longer looking for work), and at the end of 2020, when there was a resurgence of the virus, 156,000 jobs were lost in December by women, predominantly women of color. According to the National Women’s Law Center, “there were nearly 2.1 million fewer women in the labor force in December than there were in February, before the pandemic started.”So the question — for many — is, would Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, as it is known, help women get back to work, in addition to containing the spread of the virus?The answer, according to several economists, advocates and experts, is overwhelmingly, yes. The plan goes big on elements that have not traditionally been large parts of stimulus plans: public health, with funding to ramp up Covid-19 vaccine distribution and testing, and child care, without which experts say it would be difficult to reverse the so-called shecession.“For six to nine months, progressive academics have been lighting their hair on fire, saying, ‘You have to do this and this and this,’” said Michael Madowitz, an economist at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, who has been studying the effects of the pandemic on parents. “It seems like a vast majority of those ideas are actually in this package in some form.”“It’s a refreshing departure because economists often feel like they’re casting policy ideas into the void,” he added.Though, of course, the proposal is a starting point that will most likely be watered down as it works its way through Congress.The recovery package contains several proposals which may help families that are barely scraping by: expanding the unemployment insurance programs, extending paid leave and continuing a moratorium on evictions, all of which would provide an extra cushion in case people continued having trouble getting back into the work force.One of the biggest reasons so many women are out of work during the pandemic is that the burden of child care at home, caused by the closure of day cares and schools, often fell on the shoulders of mothers. Core tenets of Mr. Biden’s plan are specifically designed to tackle that reality.The plan would work to reopen kindergarten-to-eighth-grade schools within the first 100 days of the new administration, with $130 billion earmarked for resources to make it happen — from new ventilation systems to additional teaching programs that can help “make up lost learning time this year,” underscoring the fact that remote learning may have set back many children from lower-income families.The plan also dedicates about $40 billion to child care, a significant increase in funding from the $10 billion that was included in the last stimulus package that Congress passed in December. In Mr. Biden’s plan, more than half of the funding for child care — $25 billion — would help bail out providers, which were barely profitable before the pandemic and have been hanging on by a thread ever since. In a recent survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children of more than 5,000 child care providers across the country, about 40 percent stated they might have to close permanently if government help wasn’t available.An additional $15 billion would go to helping low-income families afford child care. The plan would also expand tax credits to help parents cover the cost of care for children under the age of 13, though it’s still unclear whether that means that parents can leverage that benefit only next year.Mr. Madowitz, of the Center for American Progress, said that “letting child care centers just die over the next nine months would have had a huge cost in terms of how fast we could recover.” Instead, this short-term investment will pay off for years, he added, allowing women to re-enter the work force sooner and contribute to economic growth, and potentially shift culture in a country that has never before subsidized child care in this way.All together, the proposal is “about children and parents but it’s also about the teachers and the caregivers and making sure that they have safe workplaces,” Heather Boushey, one of the top economic advisers to the incoming Biden administration, said in a call with journalists on Friday. “The package looks at both sides of that equation.”The plan also proposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25 and ending tipped minimum wage, which would have a direct effect on women, particularly Black and Hispanic women.In 2019, 68 percent of minimum wage workers and 66 percent of workers earning below minimum wage were women, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the long run, the increased hourly rate might also help close the gender pay gap, particularly in the lowest paying jobs, Mr. Madowitz said.But studies on this have been mixed; some, like this 2018 study by the Economic and Social Research Institute in Ireland, found that an increase in the minimum wage did indeed close the pay gap for the lowest earners while others have found no change.Regardless, this proposal will probably face heavy resistance by moderates and conservatives in Congress.Also, raising the minimum wage doesn’t necessarily address the issue of job security, noted Ms. Mason, of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Many of the first jobs to be cut during the pandemic were minimum wage jobs. Research in 2019 from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also suggests that if the minimum wage were to rise to $15 an hour, 1.3 million workers who would otherwise be employed would be jobless as businesses adjust payroll.“We still have some work to do on making sure that these jobs are quality jobs,” Ms. Mason added.</body>

	<title>Matthew Lewis Can’t Believe He’s a Romantic Lead, Either</title>
	<author>Sarah Bahr</author>
	<body>Matthew Lewis’s face is everywhere.On the wall to his right, grinning on a poster for the 2012 West End revival of “Our Boys,” a play by Jonathan Lewis. In the alcove behind him, arms crossed and stony-faced in a group shot for “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.” And in front of his laptop camera, eyes widening beneath his gray flat cap and dark brown hair as he explains the seemingly self-promoting background.“It’s not my house!” the 31-year-old actor said. He and his wife were paying a Christmas Eve visit to his parents in Leeds, the Yorkshire city 200 miles north of London where he was born, he explained (after quarantining for five days and testing negative for the coronavirus). But he’d overlooked the fact that their home’s study is, well, a shrine to him.“They’re very proud,” he said, as though wishing for nothing more than an Invisibility Cloak.But bashfulness is no longer necessary for the man who for a decade played the fumbling, stammering Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter films. Last year, he’d spent time in the nearby Yorkshire Dales, not far from Leeds, filming his role as Hugh Hulton, a wealthy landowner and rival suitor to the veterinarian James Herriot (Nicholas Ralph) for the affections of a farmer’s daughter, Helen Alderson (Rachel Shenton), in the reboot of “All Creatures Great and Small,” the “Masterpiece” series that began airing Sunday nights on PBS this month.The seven-episode series, which is based on James Alfred Wight’s beloved books inspired by his adventures as a young veterinarian in 1930s Yorkshire, was a surprise hit when it premiered in Britain this fall. Celebrated as an emotional balm for pandemic-weary viewers, it became Channel 5’s highest-rated show since 2016, and has been renewed for a second season.For fans who were used to Lewis as the clumsy Longbottom, his entrance at the end of the second episode comes as a shock.A decade removed from the last Potter film — he no longer looks like Draco Malfoy’s awkward, chubby-cheeked punching bag — his career has been moving away from that type of character for a while.“It wasn’t necessarily a conscious decision,” he said. “I’ve just been lucky that those are the roles I was offered.”His first post-Potter role was as Jamie Bradley, a 22-year-old retail worker who dabbled in drugs and crime but tried to turn his life around, in the BBC drama “The Syndicate” in 2012, followed by a self-centered fitness fanatic in “Me Before You” in 2016 and a single dad under house arrest in “Girlfriends” in 2018.Offscreen, he shot a shirtless cover for Attitude magazine’s swimwear issue in 2015 that left J.K. Rowling scolding him on Twitter: “warn me next time, for God’s sake” (in fairness, he didn’t give his mother a heads-up either, he said).“There was very intense pressure coming off of ‘Harry Potter,’” he said. “I didn’t want to be known as a one-trick pony.”Lewis is the latest Potter actor to find success on television recently. Harry Melling, who played Harry’s tormentor Dudley Dursley, shocked fans when he cropped up as a slim, dapper chess champ in “The Queen’s Gambit” on Netflix. Rupert Grint plays one of the four leads on the Apple TV+ series “Servant,” an M. Night Shyamalan psychological thriller. Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter himself, is an executive producer and star of the TBS comedy “Miracle Workers.”(Other Potter alumni, like Emma Watson, best known as Hermione Granger, and Robert Pattinson, who played the golden boy Cedric Diggory, have gone on to become bona fide movie stars.)But Lewis is still coming to terms with being a leading man — God forbid, a sexy one. Which is why, when the opportunity came to audition for “All Creatures Great and Small,” Lewis hesitated.“The original series is a bit of an institution in Yorkshire, and my dad really wanted me to do it,” he said. “But this guy is supposed to be very dark and handsome, and it has to be believable that Helen’s in love with him. I was like, ‘I don’t know about this. When I shave, everyone will see I look like I’m about 12.’”Even after he got the part, he still didn’t think he was in the clear. “I was dreading turning up the first day on set,” he said. “I was sure they’d be like, ‘This is what he actually looks like? Jesus, we need to recast this guy.’”But the series director, Brian Percival, who directed several episodes of the Emmy-winning drama “Downton Abbey,” was well aware of Lewis’s previous work on Potter films — and felt sure he had the experience and confidence — not to mention the Yorkshire accent — needed to pull off the part of Hugh.“I like to cast actors who can relate in some real and tangible way to the characters they are playing,” he said. “Hugh needs to have an air of natural confidence that is born of privilege, and Matthew achieved that incredibly well.”Lewis said he struggles with roles that are too similar to his own life. “I find it quite difficult when too much of me starts to come through in a character,” he said. “It’s easier when I can play someone completely different, like a police officer in London or someone who’s wealthy.”Which is why he finds it difficult to rewatch the Harry Potter films.“At times it’s painful how much of me there is in Neville,” he said. “When I’m watching, I’m like, ‘That’s not Neville; that’s you.’”David Yates, who directed the final four Potter films, said Lewis took on a greater role in shaping his character in the later films. “Matthew was very much a supporting player when I arrived to direct ‘Order of the Phoenix,’” he said. “But he became more confident, more curious, more present as the films progressed. And more ambitious.”Yates kept thinking of ways to expand Lewis’s role in scenes, ultimately building a sequence around him in “Deathly Hallows: Part 2” in which Neville blows up a bridge to Hogwarts to thwart the dark wizard Voldemort’s army — a scene that didn’t exist in either the book or in early drafts of Steve Kloves’s screenplay. “But it captured the charms of Neville and Matthew’s everyman quality,” Yates said. “He had a modesty and an honesty that was hard to ignore.”Lewis recently scored a lead role in Curtis Vowell’s upcoming New Zealand comedy “Baby Done,” as a soon-to-be father who will try anything, from drugs to a threesome, to assuage his adventurous girlfriend’s despair at the prospect of motherhood.But despite Lewis’s surging heartthrob status, his older brother Anthony said he was still a big nerd. He plans pub quizzes for family on all the holidays, including one for that evening. “He’s fiercely competitive,” Anthony Lewis said, “to the point of being obsessive. It can be quite intense and is incredibly annoying.”But if ‘former Harry Potter actor’ is the label that follows him for the rest of his career, well, Lewis said, that would be OK with him.“If there’s something people remember you by, there are worse things than the Harry Potter franchise,” he said. “It opened so many doors for me when I otherwise wouldn’t even have gotten in the room.”</body>

	<title>Morgan Wallen Debuts at No. 1 and Smashes a Country Streaming Record</title>
	<author>Ben Sisario</author>
	<body>The new year has started with a bang for the music industry, as two young stars have arrived with monster streaming hits.Morgan Wallen, a 27-year-old singer-songwriter, tops the latest Billboard album chart with his second release, “Dangerous: The Double Album,” which broke the country streaming record by a wide margin. And Olivia Rodrigo, a 17-year-old singer and actress, has a smash single with “Drivers License” that has become a social-media meme unto itself.“Dangerous: The Double Album” opens at No. 1 on the album chart with the equivalent of 265,000 sales in the United States, according to MRC Data, formerly known as Nielsen Music, which was bought by Billboard’s parent company a little over a year ago. Songs on “Dangerous” racked up 240 million streams — by far the biggest weekly tally for a country album, beating the 102 million earned by the expanded version of Luke Combs’s “What You See Is What You Get” in October.Wallen’s success is the latest step in the slowly evolving story of country music and streaming. For years, country has lagged behind hip-hop, pop and even rock in the transition to streaming, with many country fans preferring to download their favorite albums or even buy them on CD. But the pandemic has begun to change that. In 2020, country represented 7.1 percent of all on-demand music streams in the United States (counting both audio and video plays), up from 5.9 percent the year before, according to MRC.Also this week, Taylor Swift’s “Evermore” fell one spot to No. 2 and Pop Smoke’s “Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon” is No. 3. The R&amp;B singer Jazmine Sullivan’s “Heaux Tales” opened at No. 4, a new chart high for her, while Lil Durk’s “The Voice” is No. 5.The results of Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart will be released on Tuesday, but Rodrigo’s “Drivers License,” which broke Spotify’s record for the most streams in a single day for a non-holiday song, is widely expected to take easily the No. 1 spot.</body>

	<title>There’s No Easy Fix for Children’s Weight Gain</title>
	<author>Perri Klass, M.D.</author>
	<body>Even when we’re not in the middle of a terrible pandemic, there are a great many tensions around what to say and do at pediatric visits when a child’s weight is increasing too quickly.There’s the issue of self-image and fat stigma; some people remember forever the moment when a doctor first called their weight a problem, ripping the child out of the happy innocence of feeling comfortable in his or her body.The pandemic has raised worries about children’s weight gain, perhaps exacerbated by the absence of school, not to mention sports and other activities that used to give structure to the day and mark off some no-eating zones. Economic hardships and curtailed grocery shopping may be limiting some families’ ability to make healthy food choices.“Parents should allow themselves some grace,” said Dr. Eliana Perrin, professor of pediatrics and director of the Duke Center for Childhood Obesity Research. “Families are having a tough time, kids are having a tough time, there’s increased food insecurity, people have lost their jobs, kids may have lost school meals.”Dr. Sandy Hassink, a pediatrician who devoted her career to taking care of children with obesity and now works with the American Academy of Pediatrics at the Institute for Healthy Childhood Weight, and who worked on the academy’s interim guidance on obesity, said, “Even in pre-Covid times, I noticed as a clinician that nutrition and activity tend to go out the window in a time of stress.”[Click here for the recent A.A.P. statement on healthy nutrition and physical activity during the pandemic, and here for its statement on obesity management during the pandemic.]There are so many factors that have made it more difficult for families to maintain a healthy lifestyle during the pandemic, Dr. Hassink said, from increased sedentary time and screen time to the increased snacking and dysregulated sleep which sometimes come with being at home. Families may have less access to fresh food, she said, and then, of course, there’s stress eating.Pediatricians often find themselves struggling to find the right balance in what to say to a family in these situations. Somehow, in those fraught moments in the exam room, real or virtual, you have to find words to acknowledge the complexity of the problem but also, most pediatricians feel, to recognize that parents do have some power and some agency, and to offer them hope and encouragement for making at least small adjustments to help the family establish healthier patterns.Dr. Perrin and her colleagues at Duke pediatrics collected a set of suggestions for families, but before they got to the specifics of dietary change, increased activity, screen time and sleep, they started with a category they called “Survival,” advising families to pay attention to “mind, heart, body, spirit,” to avoid blaming themselves, to look for opportunities to congratulate their children for healthy behaviors and good decisions.“Forget what ‘needs’ to get done for physical activity goals and ‘perfect’ meal goals,” Dr. Perrin wrote. “Do their best to eat at home and just ‘show up’ every day in terms of physical activity.” Specific suggestions around food include involving children in the cooking, and using the government MyPlate site to plan healthy meals on a budget. For physical activity, find some way to get moving, even a little, every day.“As always, try to focus on behaviors, not weight,” Dr. Perrin wrote. “What’s important is making sure families are eating as well as they can — whole grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, drinking water — rather than a ton of fast foods or sugar-sweetened beverages, and making sure they are staying active.”Among the harshest lessons of this terrible pandemic year has been how health disparities play out across the life course, as we’ve watched higher death and disease rates in Black and brown communities. There are many issues to tackle here in terms of health equity, but for children growing up in at-risk populations, childhood obesity is yet another serious health disparity, linked to some of the underlying conditions that put people at higher risk for severe Covid-19 disease.These disparities require complex systemic fixes — from access to healthy food, to safe places for outdoor activity, to improved mental health services, to other supports that can reduce stress on families. Instead, parents and children often encounter blame and stigma.“Obesity itself as a disease presents a risk for more severe Covid infection,” Dr. Hassink said. “If I substituted the word asthma for obesity, people would not be blaming people for having asthma, they would be saying, let’s make sure your environment doesn’t have allergens, let’s make sure you get the right meds, the right medical care, but not blaming the child.”Dr. Michelle White, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Duke, is a health services researcher who studies what might be protective for families at high risk of obesity, looking at environmental and family factors, including the ways that neighborhoods can contribute to obesity risks — or solutions. “Some families reporting significant impact by Covid-19 are still able to demonstrate resilience to stress and behaviors such as physical activity and healthy diet,” she said. “I think we have a lot to learn from these families.”Dr. White said it was important not to view pandemic weight gain as a product only of diet and exercise behaviors. “The social context and the physical context of our families is so incredibly important in terms of their risk of weight gain,” she said.My colleague Dr. Mary Jo Messito, who directs the pediatric weight management program at N.Y.U. School of Medicine and Bellevue Hospital, said, “My patients are suffering terribly.” They face many barriers to exercise because of fears of being exposed to Covid, she said, and also food insecurity and a very high level of stress. “So many people don’t meet their goals because they have unaddressed mental health needs,” Dr. Messito said, pointing to the need for more mental health resources for low-income communities.“I work to try to give people resources where they are,” she said, offering handouts and information about healthy food for people on limited budgets, but acknowledging, “it’s not going to compete with fast food for calories for dollar.” She recommends in-home exercise programs or talks about how to mask up and go outside safely, and she talks about avoiding sugary drinks.Dr. Elsie Taveras, a professor of nutrition in the department of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and the chief of general pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that the challenge ahead will be to find ways to “go beyond surface counseling,” to help families find ways to turn this around, perhaps looking for help from experts in mental and behavioral health. Doctors will need to think about the dual burden of weight gain combined with the social risks brought on by the pandemic.“If a patient with obesity comes in for a visit and I also know the family is living in a motel or they’re food insecure,” she said, “I need to adapt my plan to circumstances rather than say, ‘increase fruits and vegetables.’”Pandemic weight gain is a problem for adults as well as children, Dr. Taveras said. “We’re home more, have more access to our beds, our refrigerators, our screens, we are experiencing extreme stress and uncertainty, and food and rest are things people turn to for comfort.”“It’s important for people to have self-compassion here,” Dr. Hassink said. And it’s overwhelming to tackle all of this at once. “Maybe we should be helping people pick one thing they think they could change to make it healthier, strategize about how they might make progress on one thing.”A parent might try to keep healthier food in the house, thereby eliminating all the individual decisions that have to be made “when your child starts to grab for that unhealthy snack.”Maybe start by setting a time for a particular meal, she said. Maybe make a deal with a child to stand up and walk around the house for five minutes for every so much screen time.“Take it one thing at a time that you might want to change, get help from your pediatrician about what resources might be available in your community for food and physical activity, and don’t beat yourself up,” Dr. Hassink said. “Take one small step and then be encouraged to take the next step.”</body>

	<title>Phil Spector: Listening to 15 Songs From a Violent Legacy</title>
	<author>Jon Pareles</author>
	<body>Phil Spector died Saturday as an inmate in California, convicted of the 2003 murder of Lana Clarkson. By then, other facts had emerged about his volatile, erratic, gun-toting behavior, notably in Ronnie Spector’s 1990 memoir, “Be My Baby,” which detailed his abuses during their seven-year marriage. Some listeners may well decide that all of his music is poisoned. But it is also inextricable from pop history.It was decades earlier, in the early 1960s, when Spector made the hits that he famously described as “little symphonies for the kids,” packing brash innovation into three-minute melodramas, treating adolescent romance as a universe of rapture and tragedy.He brought dozens of musicians and singers into the studio to perform together, doubling parts for heft and impact and pushing mixes to the brink of distortion, to create his Wall of Sound. He gathered songwriters who could convincingly capture female longing and desire for his girl groups to deliver. And he found singers — many of them ambitious Black teenagers — who would supercharge those songs with gospel spirit.After his prodigious hit-making streak in the early 1960s, Spector found admirers eager to work with him during the 1970s: the Beatles (collectively and individually), the Ramones, even Leonard Cohen. Then Spector withdrew from music almost completely for the next decades. But through the years, countless others — among them the Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, the Walker Brothers, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Abba, Meat Loaf and Bleachers — would emulate the thundering beat, chiming chords and lavish percussion of his Wall of Sound. “I still smile whenever I hear the music we made together, and always will,” Ronnie Spector told Billboard in an interview after Spector’s death. “The music will be forever.”Here in chronological order are 15 of his most distinctive tracks. (Listen on Spotify here.)Spector’s first hit turned the inscription from his father’s gravestone — “To know him was to love him” — into a present-tense declaration of love. The production, pre-Wall of Sound, is minimal and haunting. Annette Kleinbard sings over Spector’s gentle guitar strumming, joined by hushed backup vocals and a muffled drumbeat. Her diffidence falls away in the bridge, as her voice leaps to declare, “Someday he’ll see that he was meant for me.”In this creepy 1960s artifact written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King, the singer takes a jealous lover’s violence as proof of his affection. The masochistic premise is underscored by a cowed-sounding lead vocal, a skulking arrangement and the way the word “hit” arrives on a dissonant note. It’s even creepier given Spector’s later actions.Not wasting any potential hits, Spector often placed instrumentals on the B-sides of his singles. The flip side of “Why Do Lovers Break Each Other’s Heart?” was named for Dr. Harold Kaplan, who was Spector’s psychiatrist during the 1960s, constantly on call. Some Spector B-sides are clearly studio jams, but this is a full-fledged arrangement, with a swaggering saxophone-section melody, lots of handclaps and, partway through, somebody’s maniacal laugh.Darlene Wright, who would become Darlene Love, was the lead singer of the Blossoms, the vocal group Spector swapped in for the Crystals to record “He’s a Rebel” and used to back up the Ronettes and original Crystals. She fully earned billing on her own for “(Today I Met) the Boy I’m Gonna Marry,” showing no doubt whatsoever about her expectations for marriage while the arrangement peals around her like wedding bells.The combination of songs written with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, Spector’s productions and the youthful voices of the Crystals and the Ronettes led to the pinnacles of the Wall of Sound era. Love at first sight translates into two minutes of pure euphoria in this song, which can’t even find words for the joy: only nonsense syllables, “Da doo ron ron.” Behind the Crystals’ exultant harmonies, triplets gallop on piano and build on drums like a racing heartbeat.The opening guitar lick is a harbinger of folk-rock, and clattering castanets immediately join in to carry this chronicle of girl-group wish fulfillment from first dance to infatuation to proposal, each stage ratified with a kiss “in a way I’d never been kissed before.”One of rock’s bedrock beats — played by Hal Blaine and imitated ever since — opens a Barry-Greenwich-Spector song that’s both plea and promise. Veronica Bennett, later Ronnie Spector, soars above the band with a voice that’s wiry, vulnerable and utterly sure that her love is the answer. The Ronettes would spend decades battling Spector in court for their share of the royalties.Santa might as well be riding in on a souped-up steamroller in this full-throttle version of the song, pumped by saxophones and awash in glockenspiel — an arrangement Bruce Springsteen would turn into an annual concert staple of his own.A steady, stomping beat trudges along as Bennett sings about breaking up and inevitably making up; “I belong to you and you belong to me,” she insists. But there’s a false ending and then a new, uncertain episode. Enveloped in wordless harmonies, she’s no longer so sure things will work out, and during the fade-out she implores, “C’mon baby, don’t say maybe.”The romantic abyss opens wider and wider as Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield, the Righteous Brothers, come to terms with the end of an affair in a song written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil with Spector. They note the growing signs of estrangement as strings swell over an implacable beat and the desperation grows unbearable. Before the end, they’re both howling, “Baby! I need your love!”Spector’s run as a nonstop hitmaker ended — inexplicably — with the magnificent bombast of “River Deep, Mountain High,” which he wrote with Barry and Greenwich. Spector was determined to make a masterpiece, and the production piled on everything in his arsenal: band, horns, strings, maracas, “doot-do-doot” backup vocals — behind no less than Tina Turner revving up to full rasp before the first chorus. Whatever made the song’s first American release peak at a dismal No. 88 on the Billboard Hot 100 has long been forgotten.“Instant Karma” starts off relatively low-fi, with Lennon’s voice, a not-quite-in-tune piano and a rudimentary backbeat. But Spector’s production makes everything sound larger than life, Lennon soon works himself up to a shout and a full choir materializes behind him; it was never as casual as it seemed.George Harrison’s 1970 album “All Things Must Pass” was produced by Spector and Harrison, and “What Is Life” spurs Harrison with his own Wall of Sound, with walloping drums, a buzz-bomb guitar line, massed horns and strings and a very busy tambourine.One of greatest mismatches ever of songwriter to producer, Leonard Cohen’s album “Death of a Ladies’ Man” made Cohen raise his voice to barely hold his own against Spector’s kitchen-sink excesses. But the stately, nine-minute title cut is a grand anomaly for both of them: leisurely, orchestral, at once grave and slightly kitschy as Cohen contemplates the sexuality, revelation, metaphysics, disillusionment and comedy of a “great affair.”The last album Spector produced before decades of retirement was the Ramones’ “End of the Century,” by all accounts a collision between the Ramones’ usual quick-and-dirty recording methods and Spector’s painstaking perfectionism. But they shared a commitment to concision and drive, and Spector-style touches — huge drums, doubled guitars, layered vocal harmonies, a mid-song key change — only add to the two-minute blast.</body>

	<title>Amazon Web Drama Draws the Wrath of India’s Hindu Nationalists</title>
	<author>Suhasini Raj</author>
	<body>NEW DELHI — Bollywood once again has fallen into the cross hairs of India’s Hindu nationalist ruling party — and major Western streaming services like Amazon and Netflix increasingly find themselves caught in the middle.Two separate criminal complaints were filed with the police over the weekend against the makers of “Tandav,” a splashy new big-budget web series on Amazon. The fast-paced political drama, which seems to borrow heavily from India’s political scene, may cut uncomfortably close to current events and the country’s biggest controversies.The complainants, which include a politician with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, have insisted that the government pull the series off the air or take out key scenes. Among other objections, they accused the series of disrespecting Hindu gods, belittling members of individual castes and sullying the office of the prime minister.If the police find merit to the complaints, Amazon and the show’s promoters could wind up in criminal court.Ali Abbas Zafar, the director of “Tandav,” on Monday posted a statement on his Instagram account saying the show “is a work of fiction and any resemblance to acts and persons and events is purely coincidental.” However, the statement said, the cast and crew “take cognizance of the concerns expressed by the people and unconditionally apologize if it has unintentionally hurt anybody’s sentiments.”Officials at Amazon have declined to comment.Defenders of the show say those complaints are pretexts. The pressure on Amazon to drop the series, they say, is part of an increasingly intolerant atmosphere in India that affects even Bollywood, India’s film and entertainment industry. Actors, comedians, producers, artists and anyone who dares to question the government, even indirectly, can find their careers in peril, they say.“When you take a stand, you have to pay a price,” said Sushant Singh, a Bollywood actor who has openly campaigned against several of the government’s policies. “One doesn’t even get surprised these days. And one does not know how to react anymore.”These attitudes complicate the ambitions of both Bollywood studios and major companies to capture a huge Indian audience through their laptops and smartphones. Like the Hollywood film industry, Bollywood has increasingly turned to streaming as pandemic restrictions slam the theater business.Global companies are helping to provide the platforms for Indian viewers. Major streaming services like Amazon, Netflix and Hotstar, which is owned by Disney, have invested heavily in a country they see as holding great growth potential.But they have been caught up at times in India’s increasingly restrictive political environment.Two months ago, an on-screen kiss put Netflix into a similar bind. Hindu nationalists were outraged that a series on Netflix showed a Hindu woman kissing a Muslim man in front of a Hindu temple — a scene that the Hindu nationalists felt violated multiple taboos. The Hindu nationalists have demanded the authorities investigate Netflix and have called for a boycott. No charges have been filed.The true objection to “Tandav” may simply be that it’s too real. The opening episode looks almost like a newsreel. It cuts from farmer protests to student protests to police killings — all events that have happened in recent months under the administration of Narendra Modi, India’s Hindu nationalist prime minister.It doesn’t shy away from touchy topics. In one scene, a fictionalized Indian prime minister belittles a lower caste politician, touching on the sensitive topic of the age-old Hindu social system.Even the episode’s title is provocative. It is called “Dictator.”“They are using abusive language and trying to defame the post of the prime minister, clearly hinting at our current prime minister,” said Ram Kadam, a B.J.P. lawmaker who filed one of the criminal complaints.The authorities in Uttar Pradesh State, home to many recent police killings and run by one of Mr. Modi’s closest allies, a Hindu monk turned chief minister, seem especially offended. They said in a filing with the police there that the Amazon series portrays the post of prime minister “in a very indecent manner.” On Monday, state officials warned that the filmmakers should “prepare for arrest.”In the past few months, officials belonging to Mr. Modi’s party have ratcheted up their pressure on some of the most successful artists in the country. Critics see that pressure as an effort to quash views that question Hindu nationalist ideology, which seeks to turn India into an overt Hindu state and push non-Hindu minorities to the margins.The drug authorities have gone after leading actors on charges connected to marijuana possession. A popular comedian was recently jailed for allegedly cracking jokes about Mr. Modi’s right-hand man, Amit Shah, even though the authorities have offered no proof that the comedian said what they have alleged.The pressure extends into other walks of life. An Indian airline pilot and decorated military veteran was fired from his job this month after tweeting that the prime minister was “an idiot.”Indian cinema tends to be culturally conservative, with sex scenes and obscenities discouraged by India’s censor board. But until recently, online content in India fell into a gray area.In November, the Indian government ruled that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, which is currently run by Prakash Javadekar, a close ally of Mr. Modi, has the authority to regulate online content.Hindu nationalists are now urging the government to step in.Online broadcasts are “full of sex, violence, drugs, abuse, hate and vulgarity,” wrote Manoj Kotak, a B.J.P. lawmaker, in a recent letter to Mr. Javadekar. He closed his letter by telling the minister to set up a regulatory body for online content and “in the meantime ban controversial web series ‘Tandav.’”</body>

	<title>How Full Employment Became Washington’s Creed</title>
	<author>Jeanna Smialek</author>
	<body>As President-elect Joseph R. Biden, Jr. prepares to take office this week, his administration and the Federal Reserve are pointed toward a singular economic goal: Get the job market back to where it was before the pandemic hit.The humming labor backdrop that existed 11 months ago — with 3.5 percent unemployment, stable or rising work force participation and steadily climbing wages — turned out to be a recipe for lifting all boats, creating economic opportunities for long-disenfranchised groups and lowering poverty rates. And price gains remained manageable and even a touch on the low side. That contrasts with efforts to push the labor market’s limits in the 1960s, which are widely blamed for laying the groundwork for runaway inflation.Then the pandemic cut the test run short, and efforts to contain the virus prompted joblessness to skyrocket to levels not seen since the Great Depression. The recovery has since been interrupted by additional waves of contagion, keeping millions of workers sidelined and causing job losses to recommence.Policymakers across government agree that a return to that hot job market should be a central goal, a notable shift from the last economic expansion and one that could help shape the economic rebound.Mr. Biden has made clear that his administration will focus on workers and has chosen top officials with a job market focus. He has tapped Janet L. Yellen, a labor economist and the former Fed chair, as his Treasury secretary and Marty Walsh, a former union leader, as his Labor secretary.In the past, lawmakers and Fed officials tended to preach allegiance to full employment — the lowest jobless rate an economy can sustain without stoking high inflation or other instabilities — while pulling back fiscal and monetary support before hitting that target as they worried that a more patient approach would cause price spikes and other problems.That timidity appears less likely to rear its head this time around.Mr. Biden is set to take office as Democrats control the House and Senate and at a time when many politicians have become less worried about the government taking on debt thanks to historically low borrowing costs. And the Fed, which has a track record of lifting interest rates as unemployment falls and as Congress spends more than it collects in taxes, has committed to greater patience this time around.“Economic research confirms that with conditions like the crisis today, especially with such low interest rates, taking immediate action — even with deficit finance — is going to help the economy, long-term and short-term,” Mr. Biden said at a news conference on Jan. 8, highlighting that quick action would “reduce scarring in the work force.”Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said on Thursday that his institution is tightly focused on restoring rock-bottom unemployment rates.“That’s really the thing that we’re most focused on — is getting back to a strong labor market quickly enough that people’s lives can get back to where they want to be,” Mr. Powell said. “We were in a good place in February of 2020, and we think we can get back there, I would say, much sooner than we had feared.”The stage is set for a macroeconomic experiment, one that will test whether big government spending packages and growth-friendly central bank policies can work together to foster a fast rebound that includes a broad swath of Americans without incurring harmful side effects.“The thing about the Fed is that it really is the tide that lifts all boats,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at the payroll processor ADP, explaining that the labor-focused central bank can set the groundwork for robust growth. “What fiscal policy can do is target specific communities in ways that the Fed can’t.”The government has spent readily to shore up the economy in the face of the pandemic, and analysts expect that more help is on the way. The Biden administration has suggested an ambitious $1.9 trillion spending package.While that probably won’t pass in its entirety, at least some more fiscal spending seems likely. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect Congress to actually pass another $1.1 trillion in relief during the first quarter of 2021, adding to the $2 trillion pandemic relief package passed in March and the $900 billion in additional aid passed in December.That would help to stoke a faster recovery this year. Goldman economists estimate that the spending could help to push the unemployment rate to 4.5 percent by the end of 2021. Joblessness stood at 6.7 percent in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said earlier this month.Such a government-aided rebound would come in stark contrast to what happened during the 2007 to 2009 recession. Back then, Congress’s biggest package to counter the fallout of the downturn was the $800 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in 2009. It was exhausted long before the unemployment rate finally dipped below 5 percent, in early 2016.At the time, concern over the deficit helped to stem more aggressive fiscal policy responses. And concerns about economic overheating pushed the Fed to begin lifting interest rates — albeit very slowly — in late 2015. As the unemployment rate dropped, central bankers worried that wage and price inflation might wait around the corner and were eager to return policy to a more “normal” setting.But economic thinking has undergone a sea change since then. Fiscal authorities have become more confident running up the public debt at a time of very low interest rates, when it isn’t so costly to do so.What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.Fed officials are now much more modest about judging whether or not the economy is at “full employment.” In the wake of the 2008 crisis, they thought that joblessness was testing its healthy limits, but unemployment went on to drop sharply without fueling runaway price increases.In August 2020, Mr. Powell said that he and his colleagues will now focus on “shortfalls” from full employment, rather than “deviations.” Unless inflation is actually picking up or financial risks loom large, they will view falling unemployment as a welcome development and not a risk to be averted.That means interest rates are likely to remain near zero for years. Top Fed officials have also signaled that they expect to continue buying vast sums of government-backed bonds, about $120 billion per month, for at least months to come.Fed support could help government spending kick demand into high gear. Households are expected to amass big savings stockpiles as they receive stimulus checks early in 2021, then draw them down as vaccines become widespread and normal economic life resumes. Low rates might make big investments — like houses — more attractive.Still, some analysts warn that today’s policies could result in future problems, like runaway inflation, financial market risk-taking or a damaging debt overhang.In the mid-to-late 1960s, Fed officials were tightly focused on chasing full employment. As they tested how far they could push the job market, they did not try to head inflation off as it crept up and saw higher prices as a trade off for lower joblessness. When America took its final steps away from the gold standard and an oil price shock hit in the early 1970s, price gains took off — and it took massive monetary belt-tightening by the Fed and years of serious economic pain to tame them.There are reasons to believe that this time is different. Inflation has been low for decades and remains contained across the world. The link between unemployment and wages, and wages and prices, has been more tenuous than in decades past. From Japan to Europe, the problem of the era is weak price gains that trap economies in cycles of stagnation by eroding room to cut interest rates during time of trouble, not excessively fast inflation.And economists increasingly say that, while there may be costs from long periods of growth-friendly fiscal and monetary policy, there are also costs from being too cautious. Tapping the brakes on a labor market expansion earlier than is needed can leave workers who would have gotten a boost from a strong job market on the sidelines.The period before the pandemic showed just what an excessively cautious policy setting risks missing. By 2020, Black and Hispanic unemployment had dropped to record lows. Participation for prime-age workers, which was expected to remain permanently depressed, had actually picked up somewhat. Wages were climbing fastest for the lowest earners.It’s not clear whether 3.5 percent unemployment will be the exact level America will achieve again. What is clear is that many policymakers want to test what the economy is capable of, rather than guessing at a magic figure in advance.“There’s a danger in computing a number and saying, that means we are there,” Mary C. Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said at an event earlier this month. “We’re going to learn about these things experientially, and that to me is the right risk management posture.”</body>

	<title>Regnery Publishing picks up Senator Hawley’s book after it was dropped by Simon &amp; Schuster.</title>
	<author>Jenny Gross</author>
	<body>Regnery Publishing, a conservative publishing house, said Monday that it had picked up a book by Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, after Simon &amp; Schuster ended its contract to publish it in the wake of the assault on the Capitol.Mr. Hawley had come under criticism for challenging the results of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory and was accused of helping incite the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. His book, “The Tyranny of Big Tech,” is scheduled to be published this spring, Regnery said.Thomas Spence, the president and publisher of Regnery, said in a statement that the publishing house was proud to stand with Mr. Hawley. “The warning in his book about censorship obviously couldn’t be more urgent,” Mr. Spence said. His company’s statement said that Simon &amp; Schuster had made Mr. Hawley a victim of cancel culture.Most major publishers, including Simon &amp; Schuster, one of the “Big Five” book publishers in the United States, publish books across the political spectrum. But Simon &amp; Schuster said it called off its plan to publish Mr. Hawley’s book after the Capitol attack.“As a publisher it will always be our mission to amplify a variety of voices and viewpoints: At the same time we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat,” Simon &amp; Schuster said in a statement. The company declined to comment on Regnery’s accusations.After his book was dropped, Mr. Hawley described it as “Orwellian.”“Simon &amp; Schuster is canceling my contract because I was representing my constituents, leading a debate on the Senate floor on voter integrity, which they have now decided to redefine as sedition,” he wrote in a post.In recent years, Regnery’s best-selling authors have included Ann Coulter, the conservative pundit, and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. Mr. Hawley’s book is about technology corporations like Google, Facebook and Amazon and their political influence.While Simon &amp; Schuster will not publish the book, it will still handle its selling and shipping to international markets, since Regnery is a distribution client, said Adam Rothberg, a Simon &amp; Schuster spokesman.</body>

	<title>¿Es necesario usar dos cubrebocas al mismo tiempo?</title>
	<author>Katherine J. Wu</author>
	<body>Los entrenadores de fútbol americano lo hacen. Los presidentes electos lo hacen. Incluso los senadores entendidos en ciencia lo hacen. Conforme los casos de coronavirus siguen al alza a una escala mundial, algunas de las personalidades más reconocidas de Estados Unidos han comenzado a usar doble mascarilla: una maniobra cada vez más respaldada por los datos, según investigadores.No todo el mundo necesita dos mascarillas. Sin embargo, para la gente que usa protecciones delgadas o endebles, “si combinas varias capas, comienzas a tener una eficiencia bastante alta” para bloquear la salida de los virus y su entrada a las vías respiratorias, comentó Linsey Marr, experta en transmisión de virus del Instituto Politécnico y Universidad Estatal de Virginia, y autora de un comentario reciente en el que se describe la ciencia detrás del uso de la mascarilla.Claro está, hay una desventaja: en cierto punto, “corremos el riesgo de que la respiración se dificulte demasiado”, comentó Marr. Aunque hay bastante espacio para respirar antes de que el uso de la mascarilla se acerque a ese extremo.Después de un año de pandemia de COVID-19, el mundo luce muy diferente. Se han documentado más de 90 millones de infecciones confirmadas de coronavirus en el mundo, las cuales han dejado millones de muertes e innumerables personas con síntomas persistentes, en medio de dificultades económicas y el cierre de escuelas y negocios. Han surgido las nuevas variantes del virus, que llevan cambios genéticos que parecen mejorar su capacidad para propagarse de persona a persona.Y, aunque en este momento varias vacunas han superado los obstáculos regulatorios, el despliegue de las inyecciones ha sido inconstante y lento. Además, todavía no hay evidencia definitiva que demuestre que las vacunas tendrán un efecto significativo en la velocidad de propagación del virus y quién podría transmitirlo.A lo largo de todos estos cambios, los investigadores se han mantenido firmes sobre el uso de los cubrebocas. “Los estadounidenses no tendrán que usar para siempre las mascarillas”, dijo Monica Gandhi, especialista en enfermedades infecciosas de la Universidad de California, campus San Francisco, y coautora del nuevo comentario. Sin embargo, por ahora, deben permanecer puestas, ya que protegen al portador de la mascarilla y a la gente a su alrededor.Los argumentos a favor de la mascarilla abarcan varios campos de la ciencia, entre ellos la epidemiología y la física. Una serie de estudios observacionales ha sugerido que el uso generalizado de las mascarillas puede detener las infecciones y las muertes a una escala impresionante, en lugares tan pequeños como peluquerías y al nivel de países enteros.Un estudio, que monitoreó políticas estatales que exigían cubrirse el rostro en público, reveló que los casos conocidos de covid habían aumentado y disminuido casi al mismo tiempo que las reglas del uso de las mascarillas en práctica. Otro estudio, el cual siguió las infecciones de coronavirus entre los profesionales de la salud en Boston, resaltó una caída drástica en la cantidad de resultados positivos en las pruebas después de que los cubrebocas se volvieron un elemento universal entre el personal. Y un estudio en Pekín encontró que las mascarillas tenían una efectividad del 79 por ciento al bloquear la transmisión de la gente infectada a sus contactos cercanos.El trabajo reciente de investigadores como Marr identifica la base de estos enlaces a una escala microscópica. Según Marr, la ciencia es bastante intuitiva: los virus respiratorios como el coronavirus, que se mueve entre la gente en gotas de saliva y aerosol, necesitan un conducto claro para entrar en las vías respiratorias, las cuales están llenas del tipo de células que son infectadas por los virus. Las mascarillas que cubren la nariz y la boca limitan esa invasión.El punto no es hacer una mascarilla hermética, opinó Marr. Más bien, las fibras que la componen crean una caótica carrera de obstáculos para el aire y para cualquier cargamento infeccioso.“El aire debe seguir este tortuoso camino”, mencionó Marr. “Las cosas grandes que lleve no podrán seguir esos obstáculos”.Los experimentos que ponen a prueba hasta qué punto los cubrebocas pueden interceptar el aerosol que entra y sale han demostrado que incluso los de materiales bastante básicos, como los de tela y las mascarillas quirúrgicas, pueden tener al menos un 50 por ciento de efectividad en cualquier dirección.Varios estudios han confirmado la idea de que las mascarillas parecen ser mejores protegiendo a la gente alrededor del portador de la mascarilla que al mismo portador. “Esto se debe a que se está deteniendo justo en la fuente”, comentó Marr. No obstante, motivados por la reciente investigación, los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades han hecho notar que también hay grandes beneficios para quienes se ponen los cubrebocas.Las mejores mascarillas siguen siendo las N95, por estar diseñadas con una eficiencia de filtración ultraalta. Sin embargo, sigue habiendo pocas para los profesionales de la salud, quienes las necesitan para tratar a los pacientes de manera segura.Si pones dos capas de mascarillas menos especializadas una encima de la otra, puedes obtener una protección comparable. Marr recomendó usar cubrebocas de tela que se ciñan al rostro sobre las mascarillas quirúrgicas, las cuales suelen estar hechas con materiales que filtran mejor, pero quedan más holgadas. Una alternativa es usar una mascarilla de tela con un bolsillo que se pueda llenar con material de filtrado, parecido a los filtros que tienen las bolsas para las aspiradoras.No obstante, usar más de dos mascarillas, o poner varias capas de mascarillas que son muy buenas filtrando el aire de por sí, pronto reducirá los beneficios y dificultará mucho más una respiración normal.Otras alteraciones pueden mejorar la sujeción de los cubrebocas, como las ataduras que amarren la tela alrededor de la cabeza, en vez de los bucles alrededor de las orejas que permiten que estos cuelguen y se abran. Los puentes nasales, los cuales pueden ayudar a que la parte superior de la mascarilla quede más ceñida, también ofrecen un apoyo protector.Lograr que las mascarillas se ajusten y filtren el aire de manera óptima “es muy simple”, opinó Gandhi. “No se necesita nada sofisticado”.Ninguna mascarilla es perfecta, y usar una no reemplaza otras medidas de salud pública como el distanciamiento físico y la buena higiene. “Debemos ser honestos al reconocer que la mejor respuesta requiere intervenciones múltiples”, comentó Jennifer Nuzzo, experta en salud pública de la Universidad Johns Hopkins.El uso de cubrebocas sigue siendo poco común en algunas partes de Estados Unidos, en parte debido a la politización de la práctica. Pero los expertos señalaron que el comportamiento ejemplar de los líderes de la nación podría ayudar a cambiar el rumbo. En diciembre, el presidente electo Joe Biden imploró a los estadounidenses que usaran cubrebocas durante sus primeros 100 días en el cargo, y dijo que lo haría un requisito en los edificios de gobierno federal y en los aviones, trenes y autobuses que cruzan las líneas estatales.Una gran revisión de la evidencia detrás de las mascarillas, publicada este mes en la revista PNAS, concluyó que son una herramienta clave para reducir la transmisión en la comunidad, y que resultan más efectivas “para reducir la propagación del virus cuando el cumplimiento es alto”.Parte del mensaje también podría requerir más empatía, comunicación abierta y reconocimiento vocal de que “la gente no disfruta usando cubrebocas”, dijo Nuzzo. Sin más paciencia y compasión, simplemente doblar las restricciones para “arreglar” el mal cumplimiento será contraproducente: “Ninguna política va a funcionar si nadie va a cumplirla”.Katherine J.

	<title>Amazon Union Drive Takes Hold in Unlikely Place</title>
	<author>Karen Weise</author>
	<body>The largest, most viable effort to unionize Amazon in many years began last summer not in a union stronghold like New York or Michigan, but at a Fairfield Inn outside Birmingham, in the right-to-work state of Alabama.It was late in the summer and a group of employees from a nearby Amazon warehouse contacted an organizer in the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. They were fed up, they said, with the way the online retailer tracked their productivity, and wanted to discuss unionizing.As the workers arrived at the hotel, union officials watched the parking lot to make sure they had not been followed.Since that clandestine meeting, the unionizing campaign at Amazon’s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Ala., has moved faster and further than just about anyone has expected. By late December, more than 2,000 workers signed cards indicating they wanted an election, the union said. The National Labor Relations Board then determined there was “sufficient” interest in a union election among the warehouse’s roughly 5,800 workers, which is a significant bar to hit with the government agency that oversees the voting process. About a week ago, the board announced that voting by mail would start next month and continue through the end of March.Just getting to an election is an achievement for unions, which have failed for years to break into Amazon. But persuading the workers to actually vote for a union is a bigger challenge. The company has begun to counter organizing efforts by arguing that a union would saddle workers with dues without any guarantee of higher wages or better benefits.This will be the first union election involving the company in the United States since a small group of technical workers at a warehouse in Delaware voted against forming a union in 2014.Much has changed since that vote seven years ago, allowing organized labor to make inroads with Amazon employees in a place like Alabama. Most of that change had come in the past year during the pandemic, as workers from meatpacking plants to grocery stores have spoken out, often through their unions, about the lack of protective gear or inadequate pay.The retail union has pointed to its success representing workers during the pandemic as a selling point in Bessemer.“The pandemic changed the way many people feel about their employers,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the retail union’s president. “Many workers see the benefit of having a collective voice.”Union organizers are also building their campaign around the themes of the Black Lives Matter movement. Many of the employees at the Amazon warehouse are Black, a fact that the retail union has used to focus on issues of racial equality and empowerment. And leading the organizing effort are about two dozen unionized workers from nearby warehouses and poultry plants, most of whom are also Black.Since Oct. 20, the poultry workers have been standing outside the Amazon gates every day starting at 4:30 a.m., urging workers stopped at a traffic light to join a union.“I am telling them they are part of a movement that is worldwide,” said Michael Foster, a Black organizer in Bessemer, who works in a poultry plant. “I want them to know that we are important and we do matter.”Unions have been forming in other unlikely places this year. This month, more than 400 engineers and other workers at Google formed a union, a rare move in the mostly anti-union tech industry. The Google union is meant primarily to bolster employee activism, while the union being proposed at Amazon in Bessemer would eventually be able to negotiate a contract and would seek to influence wages and working conditions.Amazon, which has embarked on a hiring spree during the pandemic, now has more than 1.2 million employees globally, up more than 50 percent from a year earlier. But the company has also begun to face pressure from its corporate employees, over climate change and other issues, and from many warehouse workers around the country who have felt emboldened to speak up. The attention is likely to only increase with Amazon on pace to surpass Walmart as the country’s largest private employer in a few years.Success at the Bessemer warehouse, which opened in March, could inspire workers in the booming e-commerce industry more broadly, said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “If you can do it in Alabama, we can do it here in Southern California for sure,” he said. “It would have a huge ripple effect.”In a statement, Heather Knox, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the company did not believe that the union “represents the majority of our employees’ views.” She added, “Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.”The company created a website that suggests that the union’s dues — which could total about $9.25 a week for a full-time employee — would leave workers with less money to pay for school supplies.“Why not save the money and get the books, gifts and things you want?” the website says.An early version of the website included photos of happy-looking young workers, including the image of a Black man leaping in the air that appeared to be from a free stock photo website. On the site the man and a woman are pictured in an image labeled “excited african-american couple jumping, having fun.”Asked about the site, Amazon called it “educational” and said it “helps employees understand the facts of joining a union.” (As of last Tuesday evening, the company had removed the stock photos including that of the leaping man.)Race has often been at the heart of unionizing campaigns in the South. A century ago, multiracial steel and coal miners unions around Birmingham were a “cockpit of labor militancy,” Mr. Lichtenstein said.In the 1960s, unions — including the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union — gave Black workers a venue to assert their civil rights and gain more equality in the workplace.Organizing was dangerous work. A Black organizer with the retail union in Alabama named Henry Jenkins recalled being shot at and receiving death threats at his home. At one point, a bomb was found in his car outside a church in Selma. Mr. Jenkins died in 2011 after an illness.The retail union has been influential in the Northeast, where it represents workers at Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s. But its strength has also grown in the South, particularly in poultry, an industry with traditionally dangerous jobs and a work force with many Black employees.This spring, the union was active in publicizing deadly virus outbreaks in poultry plants. The union’s Mid-South Council president, Randy Hadley, called out the industry for “egregious inaction” in providing basic protections for workers.Buoyed by its rising profile during the pandemic, the union trained a group of workers to start organizing additional poultry facilities across the South. When the Amazon workers reached out, the union, which had failed to gain traction at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island two years earlier, decided to redirect the poultry workers to the Bessemer warehouse. In contrast to past campaigns, the union decided it would keep mostly quiet during the Alabama organizing drive.“Some people do not expect us to succeed,” said Josh Brewer, who is leading the organizing effort. “I believe we can do it.”On the evening of Oct. 20, two dozen poultry and warehouse workers showed up outside the Amazon gates.Mona Darby, who has spent the past 33 years processing chickens, immediately started approaching the Amazon workers in their cars as they headed home. Ms. Darby grew up in Alabama, one of 18 children. She started working as a housekeeper for local doctors and lawyers when she was 15. But she wanted more stable work, health care and retirement benefits, so she got a job in a chicken plant.Today, the starting wages in Alabama’s unionized poultry plants are about the same as those at Amazon. (The average hourly wage at the Bessemer warehouse is $15.30.) But Ms. Darby said the union provided her with protections and job security that other jobs lacked.“You can pay me $25 an hour, but if you don’t treat me well, what’s that money worth?” she said.On that first evening at the Bessemer warehouse, Ms. Darby said, a white man approached her and said that Amazon didn’t want a union and that he didn’t want her “Black ass on our property.”“You are going to see my Black ass out here all day, every day,” Ms. Darby said she had responded.Ms. Darby said she had seen the man remove his name badge before he walked up to her. She told a police officer present what the man had said, but the officer didn’t take notes.The Bessemer police said they had no record of the incident. Amazon declined to comment.On Dec. 18, lawyers for Amazon and the union gathered on Zoom to discuss how many workers would be part of the potential union.The hearing dragged on for days, as Amazon’s lawyer asked questions in minute detail about the warehouse, until the federal hearing officer eventually cut the testimony short.One issue Amazon has insisted on is that the election be held in person at the warehouse. The company even offered to rent out hotel rooms for the federal election monitors to help them isolate from contracting the virus in an area with an infection rate of 17 percent. The National Labor Relations Board ruled against in-person voting on Jan. 15, stating that a company paying for hotel rooms for government employees was not a good idea. On Friday, Amazon asked for a stay of the mail-in election, arguing that infection rates were declining and insisting that voting should take place at the warehouse.Until all the votes are cast, Mr. Foster and the other poultry and warehouse workers are planning to stay outside the Amazon gates. He said some of the Amazon workers were fearful of being seen talking to the organizers at the stoplight.On a few occasions, Mr. Foster has said a prayer with workers before the light changes to green.“We want to show them we are not leaving them until this is done,” he said.</body>

	<title>Vaccine Critics Received More Than $1 Million in Pandemic Relief Loans</title>
	<author>Stacy Cowley</author>
	<body>The Paycheck Protection Program’s loose rules allowed virtually any small business or company in America to qualify for a government-backed relief loan. Frustrated citizens and activist groups have criticized thousands of recipients they deemed unworthy, including wealthy lawyers, politicians and political lobbyists, publicly traded companies and businesses under government investigation.Now the federal loan program has drawn criticism for giving loans to organizations that have challenged the safety of vaccines.Six organizations that have made claims scientists have called false received Paycheck Protection Program loans totaling more than $1.1 million, according to data from the Small Business Administration, which manages the program. The data was released last month under a court order, in response to a lawsuit filed by The New York Times and other news organizations.The groups that received the loans are Children’s Health Defense, an organization founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; the Informed Consent Action Network; the National Vaccine Information Center; Mercola.com Health Resources and Mercola Consulting Services, both affiliated with the prominent vaccine skeptic Joseph Mercola; and the Tenpenny Integrative Medical Center, a medical practice run by Sherri Tenpenny, a physician and author whose books include “Saying No to Vaccines: A Resource Guide for All Ages.”The loans, which were made by banks and backed by the government in an effort to stave off the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, ranged in size from $72,500 to Dr. Tenpenny’s medical center to $335,000 to Mercola.com.The loans do not appear to violate Small Business Administration rules: Paycheck Protection Program loans were available to any small company or nonprofit organization (generally those with 500 or fewer workers) willing to certify that “current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary” to support their continuing operations. Small Business Association representatives did not respond to questions about the loans.The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a London-based advocacy group, uncovered the loans, and The Washington Post first reported on them.“There’s an anomaly here,” said Imran Ahmed, the group’s chief executive. “The P.P.P. was needed to deal with the economic shock of Covid, and the anti-vaxxers fundamentally inhibit our ability to defeat Covid and move past this.”Barbara Loe Fisher, the president of the National Vaccine Information Center in Sterling, Va., said by email that her group had applied for its loan “when it became apparent that lockdowns and social distancing restrictions directly threatened the job security of a number of our employees and jeopardized continued rental of our Virginia headquarters office.” The group used the loan to retain its 21 workers, she said.Ms. Fisher disputed the idea that her group is anti-vaccine. The organization “does not make vaccine use recommendations and encourages everyone to become fully informed about the risks and complications of infectious diseases and vaccines,” she said.Del Bigtree, the founder of the Informed Consent Action Network, also objected to being described as anti-vaccination, saying his group opposes “the distribution of products that are not properly safety-tested.” He does not consider the Covid-19 vaccines safe, he said.The loan allowed his organization, near Austin, Texas, to retain 10 jobs, he said.“We used the loan just as it was designed,” Mr. Bigtree said.Several of the groups have been penalized by Facebook for making misleading claims, according to Dani Lever, a Facebook spokeswoman.A page run by Dr. Tenpenny was removed in December for violating the site’s policy on misinformation, Ms. Lever said. The National Vaccine Information Center and Children’s Health Defense are barred from advertising on Facebook. Both groups’ pages, along with the Facebook page for the Informed Consent Action Network, have been removed from Facebook’s algorithmic recommendations system, which diminishes their visibility on the site.The Paycheck Protection Program distributed $523 billion to more than five million small companies from April to August to help them endure the shutdowns and other economic shocks caused by the pandemic. So long as recipients use most of the money to pay workers and comply with other rules, the loans are eligible to be fully forgiven and paid off by the U.S. government.Congress recently allocated $284 billion to restart the program, and hard-hit organizations — those whose sales have dropped by at least 25 percent since the pandemic took hold — are eligible for a second loan. Ms. Fisher said her group does not intend to apply for another loan.Mr. Bigtree said he, too, does not plan to apply again. “Our donor base has gotten much stronger through this,” he said, referring to the pandemic.The four other organizations that received Paycheck Protection Program aid did not respond to questions about their loans.Two of the groups received loans very early in the program, when funding was limited and vulnerable small companies were struggling to break through queues that often prioritized wealthy and well-connected applicants.The Tenpenny Integrative Medical Center got a loan on April 11 from KeyBank, and the National Vaccine Information Center received one four days later from Northwest Federal Credit Union. Neither lender responded to a request for comment.Mr. Ahmed’s group recently published a report on an October online gathering organized by the National Vaccine Information Center to discuss the coronavirus pandemic. Speakers at the event, including Mr. Kennedy and Dr. Tenpenny, described the Covid-19 crisis as an opportunity to expand the ranks of vaccine skeptics, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s report.Such efforts come as the United States government is working to persuade doubters that vaccines for the coronavirus are safe and effective. Some frontline workers at hospitals and nursing homes have balked at getting inoculated.Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program in late March as part of the CARES Act. The program’s rules were hastily written and frequently revised, and the relief effort has drawn heavy criticism from lawmakers and others for distributing money unevenly and unfairly, in ways that did not target the money to the neediest recipients.Loans to three of the vaccine critics — Children’s Health Defense, the Informed Consent Action Network and Mercola.com — were made in May by JPMorgan Chase. A bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the loans. Another lender, PNC, declined to comment on its loan to Mercola Consulting Services in late April.</body>

	<title>For the most part, far-right groups stayed away from protests on Sunday as statehouses turned into citadels.</title>
	<author>Thomas Fuller</author>
	<body>The last weekend of the Trump presidency wound down with state capitols across the nation ringed by barricades, military vehicles guarding closed-off streets and Washington, D.C., all but shut down. In the end, it was for a handful of protesters, most from the right, a few from the left, many looking more like ragtag stragglers than the furious mob of Trump supporters that ransacked the U.S. Capitol more than a week ago.In Concord, N.H., five masked men dressed in tactical gear and carrying assault rifles gathered on the sidewalk in front of the statehouse lawn to express concerns about “government overreach.” In Lansing, Mich., National Guard soldiers watched as a dozen members of the far-right Boogaloo Bois group showed up with military-style weapons.Across the country, legislative chambers — the people’s houses — became citadels. At least 17 states called up their National Guard.In Washington, 15,000 troops, more than the nation has stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan, established a Green Zone, adding to the impression of an occupied city. The National Guard said the troops came from all 50 states and three territories, a force that could grow to 25,000 by Wednesday.The large presence of troops and police officers across the country came after warnings from the F.B.I. that armed protests were planned in all 50 capitals and following online chatter promising demonstrations or worse in the days leading up to Wednesday’s inauguration of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as president.The nation’s militarized streets on Sunday were a remarkable spectacle as police and National Guard officers faced off with promised right-wing protests that, at least on Sunday, were reduced to a whimper. Protesters in some states could be counted on one hand.At the Massachusetts State House, where hundreds of police officers deployed around the perimeter, a pedestrian shouted, “What’s going on?”“Maybe a demonstration, maybe not,” an officer responded.But officials say they will remain on alert through Wednesday’s inauguration.</body>

	<title>Europe’s Bankruptcies Are Plummeting. That May Be a Problem.</title>
	<author>Liz Alderman</author>
	<body>PARIS — Romain Rozier’s cafe should be bankrupt by now.Since the coronavirus hit last spring, sales at the once buzzing lunch spot in northern Paris are down 80 percent. The only customers on a recent day were a couple of UberEats couriers and a handful of people spaced far apart at the counter, ordering takeout.“We’re at death’s door,” Mr. Rozier said, tallying the 300 euros ($365) he had made from the lunch shift, well below the €1,200 he used to pull in. “The only reason we haven’t gone under is because of financial aid.”France and other European countries are spending enormous sums to keep businesses afloat during the worst recession since World War II. But some worry they’ve gone too far; bankruptcies are plunging to levels not seen in decades.While the aid has prevented a surge in unemployment, the largess risks turning swaths of the economy into a kind of twilight zone where firms are swamped with debt they cannot pay off but receiving just enough state aid to stay alive — so-called zombie companies. Unable to invest or innovate, these firms could contribute to what the World Bank recently described as a potential “lost decade” of stagnant economic growth caused by the pandemic.“We need to get off of all of these subsidies at some point — otherwise, we’ll have a zombie economy,” said Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former prime minister of Sweden.Bankruptcies fell 40 percent last year in France and Britain, and were down 25 percent on average in the European Union. Without government intervention, including billions in state-backed loans and subsidized payrolls, European business failures would have almost doubled last year, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private American organization.At the Commercial Court of Paris, Judge Patrick Coupeaud, who has handled bankruptcy cases for nearly a decade, sees the difference. “I have about a third fewer people coming to me, because many troubled businesses are being helped by the state,” he said, gesturing to the court’s nearly empty colonnaded marble halls.By contrast, Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings in the United States rose in the third quarter to the highest level since the 2010 financial crisis, a trend that is expected to continue in 2021, according to an index compiled by the U.S. law firm Polsinelli.President Biden has proposed a new $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, and last week, the government reported that 900,000 Americans had filed new unemployment claims.Those statistics are shaping a debate over whether Europe’s strategy of protecting businesses and workers “at all costs” will cement a recovery, or leave economies less competitive and more dependent on government aid when the pandemic recedes.“Parts of the misery have only been delayed,” said Bert Colijn, chief eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING. He added that there would be “a catch-up in bankruptcies” and a spike in unemployment whenever support measures were withdrawn.Analysts say the government programs are already seeding the economy with thousands of inefficient businesses with low productivity, high debt and a high prospect of default once low interest rates normalize.An estimated 10 percent of companies in France were saved from bankruptcy because of government funds, according to Rexecode, a French economic think tank.Letting unviable businesses go under, while painful, will be essential for allowing competitive sectors to thrive, said Jeffrey Franks, the head of the International Monetary Fund’s mission for France.A wave of bankruptcies “is not something that’s necessarily so bad,” he said. “It’s part of the normal creative destruction process of regenerating economies.”The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is urging governments to fine-tune their support measures to ensure a revival in growth. “Failure to do so could hinder the recovery by trapping resources in nonproductive ‘zombie firms’ and jobs,” the organization said in a recent assessment.Most European governments planned to end support last autumn, figuring the coronavirus would be under control. But a second wave of cases has filled hospitals, followed by faster-spreading variants of the virus, all leading to extensions in aid. The European Union late last year approved a recovery package worth €2 trillion.In France, the investments are seen as a way of buying social stability by preventing mass unemployment. The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has pledged to maintain the support “as long as the crisis lasts,” a strategy that he described as adding “spirituality” to the economy.Almost no businesses are being left out of the largess if they lobby hard enough — not even French escargot farmers, who recently won a battle for limited financial aid while restaurants that are their main buyers stay closed.As governments’ Covid debts skyrocket, European fiscal rules have been suspended. France is among several countries declaring that they don’t plan to pay down the enormous bill until the economy has mended.For now, financial aid is preventing the collapse of many once-healthy firms whose main misfortune was the pandemic. At the Paris Commercial Court, Judge Coupeaud said the measures had helped avoid a domino effect by encouraging businesses to use state-backed loans and other aid to pay suppliers and debts.France’s bankruptcy system is unlike those in other countries, in that it encourages troubled companies to come forward before default and offers help in negotiating with creditors.“Failure is not a word that the French like to use,” said Dominique-Paul Vallée, the judge at the court in charge of helping business owners avoid bankruptcy. “We prefer to say we are saving companies.” He added that there had been a sharp rise in firms going to him for help.Those that did file for bankruptcy protection in 2020 tended to be big companies with large work forces, such as the retailer Camaïeu, with 3,900 workers, and Alinea, a furniture maker with 2,000 employees. That was a shift from the small and medium-size business cases that the court typically hears.Still, the safety net extends only so far. Countless businesses face mounting debts, declining profitability and a limited capacity to invest the longer the pandemic lasts.Mr. Rozier is a case in point. He started his organic-themed cafe, Make Your Lunch, in 2016 in a bustling business and cultural district. The concept was so successful that he opened a second cafe near the high-traffic Paris Opera.After the pandemic hit, business plunged as offices that housed thousands of workers stood empty and remained largely unoccupied most of the year.The government helped pay the bulk of his employees’ salaries, and Mr. Rozier got a low-interest €30,000 state-backed loan with payments deferred until May, which the government last week extended for a year. After a new national lockdown in October, restaurants like his got an additional €10,000 a month in direct aid.But that money hasn’t made up for months of lost sales. “My treasury is drained,” said Mr. Rozier, who sold his cafe near the opera in the summer and spent much of the government loan paying off suppliers. With 80 percent fewer clients, he is three months behind on his €4,000 monthly rent, and he struggles to pay social security taxes, electricity and other expenses.The government allows restaurants to offer takeout only. Mr. Rozier has become an unofficial spokesman for restaurant owners who demand that the government let them seat patrons again, with social distancing, to survive.After the New Year’s holiday break, he said, his morale slumped when he reopened the business.“I waited. And I waited. And three people came in the door,” Mr. Rozier said.“At this point, there is a real danger I will have to close within a couple of months,” he continued. “I’d rather sell the business than have to go to bankruptcy court.”Two of his friends, also restaurant owners, have already declared bankruptcy.“There are many more that will follow in their footsteps,” Mr. Rozier said. “That we know for sure.”Antonella Francini contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Run for Arkansas Governor</title>
	<author>Maggie Haberman</author>
	<body>Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as a White House press secretary under former President Donald J. Trump, announced her candidacy for governor of Arkansas on Monday, running for a seat her father, Mike Huckabee, once held.Ms. Sanders is seen as the preferred candidate of Mr. Trump for the election in 2022, and her candidacy will serve, to some extent, as a test of Mr. Trump’s remaining strength in the Republican Party. The party has found itself divided after the tumultuous final weeks of Mr. Trump’s presidency, his false claims of widespread voter fraud and his role in igniting a riot by his supporters at the Capitol on Jan. 6.She announced her run in a video posted on her website Monday morning.When Ms. Sanders resigned as press secretary, in June 2019, Mr. Trump suggested that she run for governor in Arkansas. She is expected to face a primary, but her name recognition is expected to give her a boost at the outset.Ms. Sanders already has a fund-raising team in place, a person briefed on her plans said. The current governor, Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, cannot run again because of term limits.As press secretary, Ms. Sanders was one of Mr. Trump’s favorite advisers. But she also was a lightning rod for criticism, particularly for her frequent sparring with reporters from the White House briefing room.Reporters often called out Ms. Sanders for telling falsehoods from the podium; in the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who investigated possible conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, she acknowledged that a claim she made about knowing F.B.I. agents were pleased by the firing of James B. Comey was not based in fact.Yet the qualities that could harm her in a battleground state in a general election — her ties to Mr. Trump, and her loyalty to him — are assets in Arkansas, where the president remains popular. In the video announcing her candidacy just after 7 a.m., Ms. Sanders spent more time talking about Mr. Trump than she did about her father.She made clear her campaign would use the touchstones of Republican arguments in recent months, saying that she “took on the media, the radical left and their cancel culture,” and that while she had been targeted by media outlets, she would “never let them silence you.”The video opened with footage of Ms. Sanders traveling with Mr. Trump to Iraq, and meeting a soldier there who she said praised her for how she handled herself on the job.Ms. Sanders, who in a recent autobiography described the difficulty of raising children while doing her job, said she was the “third woman and first mom to serve as White House press secretary.”Private polling shows Ms. Sanders as the prohibitive favorite in the primary, which currently includes Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and the state’s attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, according to a person who has seen the data.</body>

	<title>Shopping for Compact Dining Tables</title>
	<author>Tim McKeough</author>
	<body>A dining table doesn’t necessarily need to accommodate a dozen people. Especially in a small apartment, a table with more conservative dimensions is often a smarter choice — or simply the only thing that will fit.“In smaller-scale apartments, the size of the table is dictated by the size of the apartment,” said Alexander M. Reid, an interior designer in New York. Often, there is no dedicated dining room, he added, so it’s a matter of finding a table you can put in the kitchen, the foyer or one end of the living room.For tight spaces, Mr. Reid looks for a table that’s no more than 48 inches in diameter. And if your space is extremely limited, the table could be as small as 28 inches wide. “You can still seat two people at it,” he said. “But anything smaller than 28 inches is a side table.”In his own apartment, Mr. Reid has a compact oval table.“You can go from fitting four people comfortably to even eight, if you squish ’em,” he said. “That’s not appropriate right now, with Covid, but I’ve done it before.”What’s the most functional kind of base? “A pedestal table is often best,” Mr. Reid said, “because legs can be cumbersome if you need to fit more people.”Are some shapes better than others? Tables with circular or oval-shaped tops provide more flexibility for squeezing in extra guests and are less likely to interfere with circulation.How many chairs should go around the table? Two or four is usually best, Mr. Reid said: “Then I always float some chairs in my living room, entry and bedroom that can be pulled up for a dinner party.”Mahogany pedestal table from Noir$2,091 at Chairish: 855-549-9990 or chairish.comStone powder, cement and natural fiber table by Mermelada Estudio$899 at CB2: 800-606-6252 or cb2.comSquare or rectangular walnut table with choice of leg colorFrom $850 from Tronk: 513-549-0210 or tronkdesign.comTable with tapered wood base and marble top from Arteriors$3,290 at Lumens: 877-445-4486 or lumens.comOak dining table by Space Copenhagen for MaterFrom $1,680 at Fair: 212-352-9615 or fair-design.comFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

	<title>Portugal’s President Wins Re-election, but Far Right Gains</title>
	<author>Raphael Minder</author>
	<body>Portugal’s center-right president was re-elected on Sunday to a second term in office, but the vote also confirmed the rise of a far-right politician who formed his party less than two years ago.Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Portugal’s center-right president, secured a new five-year term after winning about 61 percent of the vote.The election on Sunday took place in extraordinary circumstances, coming less than two weeks after the Portuguese government put the country back under lockdown as a new wave of the coronavirus threatened to overwhelm hospitals.The Socialist candidate, Ana Gomes, won about 13 percent of the vote, just ahead of André Ventura, a far-right, ultranationalist candidate who got almost 12 percent of the vote, the results showed.Mr. Ventura’s performance made clear that he has emerged as a force in Portugal. His anti-migration campaign and other demands in large part mirror those of more longstanding far-right politicians like Marine Le Pen of France.Mr. Ventura, 38, a lawyer by training who first gained fame as a soccer commentator, was the first lawmaker to win a seat in Parliament for his newly formed party, Chega!, which means “enough.” Until that victory, in 2019, Portugal had long stood out in Europe for not having a far-right presence in its legislature.Late on Sunday, Mr. Rebelo de Sousa paid tribute to the victims of the pandemic and thanked voters for re-electing him. He acknowledged that “this now-renewed confidence is anything but a blank check.”Mr. Ventura, celebrating “a historic night,” cast the vote as a breakthrough for his party, which he described as “openly anti-system.” He campaigned on issues like imposing stronger prison sentences for sex offenders and reducing the number and salaries of lawmakers, as part of his broader attack on the privileges enjoyed by Portugal’s elite.Last year, the Commission for Equality and Against Racial Discrimination in Portugal fined Mr. Ventura for comments he had posted on social media, particularly against the Roma population.Mr. Rebelo de Sousa, 72, appeared a strong favorite to be re-elected as president, a role that is secondary in Portugal to that of the government, which runs the country day to day and is led by Prime Minister António Costa, a Socialist.The president, however, is more than a ceremonial figure, and has a role over foreign policy and national security as commander of the armed forces, as well as the power to dissolve Parliament and veto some legislation.In the days ahead, Mr. Rebelo de Sousa will need to decide whether to approve or block a recent law passed by lawmakers but opposed by the Catholic Church permitting euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The president could also seek a review of the law by Portugal’s Constitutional Court.Turnout on Sunday was about 39 percent, according to the preliminary results, a sign that many registered voters stayed home amid concerns about the new wave of the coronavirus. The lockdown requires residents to stay indoors except for special reasons.Last week, the government also decided to shutter schools and universities, in addition to the closure of nonessential stores already in effect.After visiting a hospital last week, Mr. Rebelo de Sousa warned that the surge in infections was creating “big pressure on health care structures that we had not seen in March.” That, he warned, may lead to “a much longer lockdown” than the one-month period initially established by the government.</body>

	<title>How Parler Reveals the Alarming Trajectory of Political Violence</title>
	<author>Heather Hurlburt</author>
	<body>Since the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol in Washington, right-wing extremists on social media continue to glorify violence, draw new adherents and forge fresh plans for mayhem. This ominous activity presents an urgent threat to the security and social cohesion of the United States.But there is another, less obvious takeaway: Experts know — or can know — an enormous amount about the nature and evolution of the threat.Data sleuths have combed through a 70 terabyte cache of data from Parler, the now-defunct social media platform popular among the far right. Researchers have archived and mapped millions of these ethically hacked posts, wrangled by an anonymous, purportedly Austria-based hacker. The haul — potentially bigger than the WikiLeaks data dump of the Afghan War logs and the Democratic National Committee leak, combined — includes valuable evidence and planning of further attacks, mixed in with the private data of individuals who committed no crimes (along with quite a bit of pornography). The early takeaways are terrifying: According to at least one preliminary analysis, the frequency of hashtags on Parler referencing hanging or killing duly elected members of Congress more than doubled after the November elections.Until the nation reckons with the self-inflicted wounds stemming from an under-regulated, unreformed social media information architecture, President Biden’s calls for healing and national unity won’t produce substantial, lasting results. The new administration needs a long-term plan to confront the escalating threat, as far-right insurgents migrate from one platform to the next.The Parler hack is the place to start. It indicates that moderation of violent, racist, anti-democratic content will increasingly lead to migration of that same hateful content. For instance, the deplatforming of Parler triggered a virtual stampede to similar forums like Gab and Rumble. Analysts have already documented Parler groups re-forming and spreading evermore hateful content on Telegram and a host of smaller platforms.As the Parler case study also showed, deplatforming also disappears valuable data. But extremists don’t just vanish — they tumble into “smaller and smaller rabbit holes,” in the words of researcher Peter Singer. Those rabbit holes make up a large, growing and uncontrollable far-right media universe.Since a number of large tech companies stopped supporting Parler, it was resurrected in a new form — a landing page that promised a full return — on the same web hosting service that provides a platform for The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi message board. The move suggests that even if big tech giants get rid of toxic content, smaller companies will step in as safe havens.That could change. There are mounting calls in Congress for investigations into the role played by Parler and other social media platforms in the siege in Washington. Inaction risks the very real possibility that countries like Russia may offer themselves as a web hosting alternative for violent anti-democratic factions inside the United States: Parler has reportedly engaged in business dealings with Russian-owned tech firms.Deplatforming, then, must be coupled with better, faster and more comprehensive data collection and analysis. Facebook, Twitter and others must also be more transparent about preserving evidence of account takedowns, so disinformation researchers can put the pieces together for a public thirsty for accountability from Silicon Valley.While the tech industry must take more assertive action on moderation, policymakers must also acknowledge that the self-policing model adopted by Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon and others is broken. All sides would be better served by the adoption — and vigorous enforcement — of legal norms for online content moderation, incitement and expectations of privacy.In the long run, this shift will also help Silicon Valley firms manage competing expectations from major global markets, which have often instituted much more aggressive government oversight. The question for the United States is whether the future of the internet runs toward Europe’s community-oriented version or Beijing’s authoritarian-empowerment model.The threats to national security posed by this information disorder demand more open collaboration between policymakers, the tech industry and the research community. Together, they must accept the fact that the internet ecosystem of right-wing extremism is vast, and that the risk of its exponential expansion on the dark web is substantial.Nearly a decade ago, former C.I.A. director Leon Panetta’s warning of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor” evoked images of a Russian, Chinese or Al Qaeda-led attack on American infrastructure. But few imagined that American democracy could be taken out by what is effectively a virtual suicide bomb, driven by millions of U.S. citizens exercising their First Amendment rights.The future of American democracy depends on our defusing that bomb — together.Candace Rondeaux (@CandaceRondeaux) is a senior fellow with the Center on the Future of War, a joint initiative of New America and Arizona State University.

	<title>Dominion Voting Systems threatens to sue Mike Lindell, MyPillow C.E.O., over false claims.</title>
	<author>Maggie Haberman</author>
	<body>Officials with Dominion Voting Systems have sent Mike Lindell, the C.E.O. of MyPillow, a legal letter warning of pending litigation over his baseless claims of widespread fraud involving their machines.“You have positioned yourself as a prominent leader of the ongoing misinformation campaign,” the letter said, referring to his continued false claims that their systems were rigged by someone to effect the outcome.“Litigation regarding these issues is imminent,” the letter said. Mr. Lindell is only the latest to get a warning letter from Dominion officials about potential litigation, after he and Sidney Powell, the right-wing lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani and others have continued to spread false claims about the integrity of the results the machines showed.Mr. Lindell visited Mr. Trump at the White House briefly on Friday, before the national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, steered him away.In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Lindell said he welcomed a lawsuit from Dominion.“I would really welcome them to sue me because I have all the evidence against them,” he said. “They sent this letter a couple of weeks ago. They’re lying, they’re nervous because I have all the evidence on them.”</body>

	<title>What to Cook Right Now</title>
	<author>Sam Sifton</author>
	<body>It’s a federal holiday, a day of service, commemorating the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1929. He would have been 92. Before you think of food today, spend a little time reading his sermons and speeches, and our accounting in The New York Times of his assassination in 1968. He was 39.Later, you can cook. Maybe make a pecan pie? It’s a dessert King was said to love. Then, for dinner: red curry lentils with sweet potatoes and spinach, shrimp scampi with orzo, or this amazing chicken French (above).Or, have you made our Darun Kwak’s recipe for kimbap? I went rogue on it the other day, first assembling rice rolls with strips of omelet and deli ham, quick kimchi, carrots and cucumber, then making more with smoked salmon candy and topping the nori with salmon roe. As you’ll see if you read the notes below the recipe, this was very much in keeping with kimbap philosophy. As one subscriber wrote: “Endlessly adaptable!”Today might be good for goulash, or charred cauliflower stew. With the day off work, I could see making pizza dough at lunchtime, and using it tonight: a plain pizza pie, perhaps, or a white pie topped with Taleggio and Parmesan. (My friend Jamie added roasted mushrooms to that one once, a final pizza after a night of cooking them in his outdoor oven in the snow, and it was a great way to end the game.)You could make Nigerian fish pepper soup. Or Manchurian chicken. Or a very British Guinness pie.There are thousands more recipes to choose from waiting for you on NYT Cooking. Go take a look and see what jumps out at you, what you find. You can save the recipes you want to make. And rate the ones you’ve made. You can also leave notes on them, if you discover something about a recipe you want to remember or share with your fellow subscribers.Yes, subscribers. By subscribing, you support the work of dozens of people who work to make the site and apps possible. You allow that work to continue. I hope if you haven’t already, that you will subscribe to NYT Cooking today.Meanwhile, you can reach out to us directly if something goes sideways along the way, either with your cooking or our technology. We’re at cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you. (I’m at foodeditor@nytimes.com. I read every letter sent.)Now, it’s a far cry from belly tuna and fried chickpeas, but it’s been 20 years since the publication of Peter Carey’s “True History of the Kelly Gang,” and well time to read it if you haven’t, and re-read it if you have.Of course you should take a look at Brian Hiatt’s Neil Peart article in Rolling Stone, perhaps especially if you don’t know anything about him or his math-rock legacy. Also, Monte Burke on Nick Saban, in Garden &amp; Gun.In this stressful time, our Sam Anderson recommends eating chips.Finally, here’s Bud Powell playing “Get Happy” at the Blue Note in Paris in 1959. Get happy and I’ll see you on Wednesday.</body>

	<title>Yellen Readies Big Changes for Treasury</title>
	<author>Alan Rappeport</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Janet L. Yellen, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, will tell lawmakers at her confirmation hearing on Tuesday that the United States needs a robust set of fiscal stimulus measures to get the pandemic-stricken economy back on track and that now is not the time to worry about the nation’s mounting debt burden.Ms. Yellen’s support for a large stimulus package comes as Mr. Biden prepares to push through a $1.9 trillion relief plan once he assumes the presidency. If confirmed, Ms. Yellen will be responsible for helping to shepherd that package through Congress and to oversee carrying it out.“Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,” Ms. Yellen will say, according to a copy of her opening remarks, which were reviewed by The New York Times.It will not be an easy task. Democrats hold a slim majority in Congress and Republicans have already expressed concern about Mr. Biden’s plan and its impact on the budget deficit, which topped $3 trillion last year.Ms. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, will argue that “the benefits will far outweigh the costs.” And she will portray her job as having two mandates: helping people to stay afloat until the pandemic is over and rebuilding the economy so that Americans can better compete in a globalized world.If confirmed, Ms. Yellen is expected to bring a very different perspective to the job than her predecessor, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. That includes Ms. Yellen’s approach to financial regulation and protecting the economy against systemic risks.Two years ago, Ms. Yellen co-signed a letter to Mr. Mnuchin urging him not to move forward with plans to relax oversight of big financial firms, warning that doing so could threaten the stability of America’s financial system.The plea by Ms. Yellen, who was joined by Ben Bernanke, another former Fed chair, and former Treasury secretaries Jacob J. Lew and Timothy F. Geithner, went unheeded. Under Mr. Mnuchin’s direction, the Financial Stability Oversight Council pressed ahead with plans to stop designating large, nonbank financial institutions like insurers and asset managers as a threat to the financial system, chipping away at a key pillar of the post-financial crisis regulatory era.Now Ms. Yellen is poised to restore some of the Trump administration’s regulatory rollbacks if she wins Senate confirmation.Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday is expected to focus largely on Ms. Yellen’s plans to revive a pandemic-stricken economy. But she will also be under pressure to show Democrats and progressive groups that she is ready to end what they view as Mr. Mnuchin’s coddling of Wall Street.In recent weeks, Ms. Yellen and Wally Adeyemo, Mr. Biden’s nominee for Treasury’s deputy secretary, have been on a virtual listening tour of industry groups across Washington. According to people who participated in those sessions, the two have emphasized the need to create “equitable growth,” using the tools of the Treasury Department to combat climate change and rebuild regulatory institutions like the F.S.O.C.“There’s an emphasis on working people, racial justice and inequality, and that’s a good place to start,” said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group that met with Ms. Yellen this month. “But reversing things that the current Treasury Department has done is not enough.”Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning organization that has spent the past four years largely shut out of the Treasury Department, wants Ms. Yellen to set a new direction for the F.S.O.C., which has the power to subject big financial firms to stricter oversight. It was created by the 2010 Dodd Frank law to prevent a repeat of what happened in the run-up to the financial crisis, when firms like the insurance giant AIG made risky bets outside of regulators’ reach and then needed to be bailed out by taxpayers.Its power has been winnowed under the Trump administration, which released AIG and three other financial firms from stricter oversight.Americans for Financial Reform has urged Ms. Yellen and transition officials to harness F.S.O.C.’s power to designate climate change as a “systemic risk” and create tools to limit leverage at hedge funds, which are only lightly regulated.Ms. Yellen likely has a new regulatory approach in mind. She called last year for a “new Dodd-Frank,” arguing at a Brookings Institution event that existing laws were insufficient for dealing with problems in the “shadow” banking sector that emerged when the pandemic caused severe market turmoil.The former Fed chair has also demonstrated that she is willing to punish banks for misdeeds when warranted. In 2018, on Ms. Yellen’s last day on the job, the Fed required Wells Fargo to replace four members of its 16-person board for failing to properly oversee the bank amid a fraud scandal.But Ms. Yellen’s experience at the Federal Reserve and her understanding of the banking system have eased concerns among some in the financial sector who might otherwise be wary that an incoming Democratic administration will quickly roll out onerous new rules. In meetings with financial services groups, Ms. Yellen has indicated that helping to craft and oversee the Biden administration’s economic relief efforts will initially be her top priority.“She’s extremely knowledgeable about the banking system; she’s familiar with the strength and the role of the large banks, including the positive role that they have played over the last year,” said Kevin Fromer, chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, a lobbying group that also met with Ms. Yellen this month.Ms. Yellen will have to recuse herself from Treasury matters involving certain financial institutions as a result of an ethics agreement she signed when disclosing paid speeches that she gave to major corporations and Wall Street banks since leaving the Federal Reserve in 2018. According to her financial disclosure, which was released on New Year’s Eve, Ms. Yellen earned more than $7 million in speaking fees from firms such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Citadel.Jeff Hauser, the director of the Revolving Door Project, called on Ms. Yellen to release the contents of her speeches. But he said that they were less troubling than some of the consulting work that Mr. Biden’s other nominees have done in recent years for firms such as Blackstone, a giant asset manager run by Stephen Schwarzman, and the data-mining company Palantir.The Biden transition team has declined to make videos or transcripts of the speeches public, noting that she was usually participating in unscripted discussions about the economy.“Yellen did not deliver prepared remarks at her speaking engagements; most were armchair conversations where she answered questions from a moderator and some of whom were reporters,” said Sean Savett, a Biden transition spokesman. “She has already signed ethics agreements governing her relationship with these entities and she will of course abide by all appropriate recusals.”Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee could question Ms. Yellen about the speaking fees, but Democrats are unlikely to press her on the issue.“This is the worst economic crisis in 100 years, and nobody is better qualified than Secretary-designate Yellen to lead an economic recovery,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who will become the Finance Committee chairman when Democrats take control of the Senate. “She deserves much of the credit for the longest economic expansion in our history, which lasted until the pandemic hit.”The confirmation process is expected to be a relatively smooth one. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, currently Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, has spoken positively of Ms. Yellen since Mr. Biden picked her for the job.Mr. Grassley said on Friday that he had spoken to Ms. Yellen and said he emphasized to her the importance of cooperation with congressional oversight, and also expressed concern that tax increases and more regulation would slow the economic recovery.In 2014, the Senate confirmed Ms. Yellen to be Fed chair by a vote of 56 to 26.While Ms. Yellen, an economist by training, has a deep understanding of monetary policy, the portfolio at the Treasury Department is vast. She will likely face questions about America’s economic relationship with China, her position on sanctions policy as it relates to Iran and her thoughts on tax policy. She could even face questions on thorny subjects that Treasury deals with, such as whether Harriet Tubman should be the face of the $20 bill, an Obama administration initiative that Mr. Mnuchin let lapse.Ahead of Ms. Yellen’s hearing, several groups have suggested that they are enthusiastic for a change in tone and personnel at Treasury. Mr. Mnuchin has managed the department with a small staff and was most receptive to executives from large banks and companies.Luz Urrutia, chief executive of Opportunity Fund and the Accion Opportunity Fund, said she came away feeling hopeful after a meeting with Ms. Yellen last month about Community Development Financial Institutions. The Trump administration repeatedly tried to cut funding for the CDFI Fund’s grant programs, which Treasury oversees. Ms. Yellen told the group that she wanted to expand the lending capacity of CDFIs so that to that they can better serve minority communities.“They did not think that CDFIs provided the level of impact and ability to serve these communities,” Ms. Urrutia said of the Trump administration. “It’s a stark difference between Yellen and the current administration.”In her testimony, Ms. Yellen will make clear that fostering greater equality is a priority.“People worry about a K-shaped recovery but well before COVID-19 infected a single American, we were living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built on wealth while working families fell further and further behind,” she will say. “This is especially true for people of color.”</body>

	<title>How Options Trading Could Be Fueling a Stock Market Bubble</title>
	<author>Matt Phillips</author>
	<body>The stock market is near record highs, and optimism abounds. Coronavirus vaccines are finally being jabbed into arms. Interest rates are at historic lows. And the Democrats who control Washington are expected to pour another trillion dollars or so into the still-struggling economy.But it’s getting increasingly difficult to overlook signs that investors are taking things too far, too fast.The latest signal is from the somewhat obscure market for stock options, where traders can place bets with brokers that a stock will rise or fall. Speculation has reached a frenzied level not seen since the tail end of the dot-com boom two decades ago. That enthusiasm is having a growing influence over the regular stock market itself.“If you’re betting on sports, the amount of people on one side of the bet or another can only influence the odds, not the outcome,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Conn., a major options brokerage. “In the case of options, it can actually change the outcome.”Over the past year, and even during the deep uncertainty that flummoxed the market at the start of the pandemic, individual investors — often with little experience — have been pouring into the market. What has lured them varies: free trades, extra cash from relief payments or even an itch for action with most sports leagues shut down.Options trading hit a record in 2020, with some 7.47 billion contracts traded, according to the Options Clearing Corporation. That was 45 percent higher than the previous record, set in 2018.Much of this money has come from small-time traders hoping to make fast gains by buying “calls” — bets on rising markets — set to expire quickly.The skew is evident in something called the put-call ratio, which shows how many contracts are betting on gains compared with those betting on losses through “put” options. On Friday, the 50-day moving average of that ratio was 0.42, near the lowest level in two decades. The last time it was this tilted for this long was 2000, meaning options investors are more optimistic, or greedy, than they have been in over two decades.The combination of the sudden growth in options trading and the unbridled optimism of the buyers is a market-moving force in itself.An individual who wants to make a bet that a stock price is going to rise can buy a call option at a brokerage firm. This contract gives the buyer the right — but not the obligation — to buy a stock at a given price at some point in the future. If the share price is higher on that date, the buyer can purchase the shares using the contract, then sell them for a profit.But just as the buyer stands to benefit from a rising share price, the dealer who sold the contract stands to lose.Brokerage firms make money by charging fees on products, not by predicting where share prices go. So to hedge their risk on a given contract, they buy a calculated percentage of the stock they would be forced to sell if the buyer ended up making money on the bet.But as the stock prices rise, brokers must buy more shares to keep their hedges in balance. And buying more shares helps push share prices up.In other words, rising share prices boost demand for shares even further, all because of market dynamics — not because of a fundamental view that the company’s business prospects are improving.“In this situation, dealers are amplifying price movements,” said Andrea Barbon, an assistant professor of finance at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, who recently co-wrote a paper that analyzed the relationship between the options markets and market volatility.The result can be an options market that itself has become a generator of share-price momentum and stocks that appear increasingly untethered from bedrock fundamentals, like expectations for corporate earnings. “The fundamentals aren’t the driver. That’s not what matters anymore,” said Charlie McElligott, a market analyst with Nomura Securities in New York. “It’s the scale and the growth of the options market as this lottery ticket vehicle, which is especially magnified right now because of the retail frenzy.”The overwhelming optimism of stock options investors — and the chance that they are fueling a feedback loop of ever-escalating stock prices — is one of the reasons some analysts are concerned that a bubble might be building in the market.If history is any guide, such bubbles tend not to last. The frenzy back in 2000 was followed by a roughly two-and-a-half-year downturn as the stock market plunged 40 percent.The downturn doesn’t have to be that steep. In August, the put-call ratio tilted hard as bullishness took hold. Stocks then suffered a sudden tumble in early September, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping more than 7 percent over three weeks. The sell-off was led by the same giant technology companies — including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, Google’s parent — that had led much of the market’s monthslong rally.Few analysts saw a fundamental reason for the drop.“High levels of speculation usually do run their course,” Mr. Sosnick said.But for now there are few indications that investors have had their fill.Since the sharp setback for tech stocks in September, retail traders have redoubled their interest in buying single-stock options, which have become especially popular among online amateurs who gather on Reddit and Discord to swap ideas and fawn over screenshots of both purported wins and gut-wrenching losses.The momentum will probably last until markets turn down and these newly minted traders experience painful losses that, for many, will be the first in what has been an extremely short investing career.“Are these the types of people who have the ability, the acumen, the pain tolerance to stay disciplined and not create a stampede of new investors out the door?” Mr. McElligott asked.If they flee, it will only magnify any fall.“That’s where it can get combustible,” he said.</body>

	<title>Incest Scandal Sets Off a New #MeToo Movement in France</title>
	<author>Constant Méheut</author>
	<body>PARIS — The testimonies have surfaced by the hundreds.“I was 8, I was abused by my uncle,” read one post on Twitter. “My father, from 7 to 14 years old,” another tweet said. “It was supposed to be a vacation, which quickly turned into a nightmare,” someone else posted.A scandal involving a prominent French intellectual accused of sexually abusing his teenage stepson has prompted a wave of testimonies on social media from people in France who say they were also victims of incest, shedding light on what campaigners say is a major problem.Just as the #Metoo movement gained momentum on social networks three years ago, France’s current reckoning on incest has been driven by a hashtag, #Metooinceste, under which some 20,000 tweets had been posted as of Monday afternoon. Hundreds of the posts were wrenching accounts from people who said they had been sexually abused as children by adult family members.“Victims’ voices are getting louder,” said Patrick Loiseleur, the vice president of Facing Incest, a French organization that has advocated for better recognition of the extent of the issue.French law defines incest as a sexual relationship between two people who are related to each other to a degree where marriage is prohibited, including between siblings or between stepparents and stepchildren. But French law criminalizes incest only in the case of sexual abuse, such as rape or a sexual relationship between an adult and a minor.The deluge of testimonies on Twitter have come in the wake of the scandal surrounding Olivier Duhamel, a prominent political scientist and TV commentator, who was accused by his stepdaughter, Camille Kouchner, of having abused her twin brother, starting when he was 14. Such abuse would be considered incest under French law, even though the boy was Mr. Duhamel’s stepson.In a book released 11 days ago, “La Familia Grande,” Ms. Kouchner recounts how Mr. Duhamel abused her brother at night before he went to bed for a period of about two to three years. She writes that her brother, who told her about the abuse, had asked her to keep “this secret.”“Anger didn’t come right away,” Ms. Kouchner writes. “Misunderstanding persisted for a long time, followed by silence, for an even longer time.”A study released in November by Facing Incest and the polling firm Ipsos revealed that one in 10 French people say they have been the victim of incest, a proportion that has increased over time as more people have felt emboldened to come forward. According to the polling firm, the proportion was 3 percent in 2009 and 6 percent in 2015.Brigitte Macron, the French first lady, told TF1, a French TV station, on Sunday, “It is absolutely necessary that these actions are known, and that these actions are not silenced.”Mr. Loiseleur said, “Incest is like the elephant in the room that nobody wants to see,” adding, “It is the most widespread form of sexual violence and the least talked about.”Similar to the scandal around the pedophile writer Gabriel Matzneff, the allegations against Mr. Duhamel have caused a significant stir within the French establishment. Mr. Duhamel was a towering figure as the head of the governing board overseeing the prestigious Sciences Po university in Paris and president of “Le Siècle,” an elite social club in the capital. Suspicions have grown over the past two weeks about who might have known about the accusations and kept silent.Frédéric Mion, the director of Sciences Po, who according to the newspaper Le Monde had known about the allegations since 2018, has been under pressure from his students to step down. Élisabeth Guigou, a former justice minister and close friend of Mr. Duhamel, resigned last week as the head of a committee on sexual violence against children, but she said she had been unaware of the alleged abuse.Mr. Loiseleur said incest needed to be identified “as a public health issue that requires significant resources.” His organization has long called on the authorities to make incest a specific crime, with no statute of limitations.France recently extended the statute of limitations for rape against a minor to 30 years, from 20 years, and two bills that would create an age of consent for sexual relationships with a minor will soon be introduced for examination in Parliament.French laws prohibit sex between an adult and a minor under the age of 15, but it is not automatically considered rape. Further circumstances, such as the use of coercion, threats, or violence, are necessary to characterize such sexual relationships as rape.Alexandra Louis, a French lawmaker, said that she was working on a bill that would effectively criminalize incest and strengthen the criminalization of sexual relationships between an adult and a minor under the age of 15.In many cases at the moment, she added, “Incest has no real consequences in terms of criminal punishment.”</body>

	<title>Martinus Veltman, Who Made Key Contribution in Physics, Dies at 89</title>
	<author>Dylan Loeb McClain</author>
	<body>Martinus J.G. Veltman, a Dutch theoretical physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for work that explained the structure of some of the fundamental forces in the universe, helping to lay the groundwork for the development of the Standard Model, the backbone of quantum physics, died on Jan. 4 in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. He was 89.His death was announced by the National Institute for Subatomic Physics in the Netherlands. No cause was given.There are four known fundamental forces in the universe: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force that bonds subatomic particles together, and the weak force that is responsible for particle decay. Since the discovery of the last two forces in the first half of the 20th century, physicists have looked for a unified theory that could account for the existence of all four.In the early 1960s, Dr. Sheldon Lee Glashow, Dr. Steven Weinberg and Dr. Abdus Salam developed what they called the electroweak theory, which found a unity between electromagnetism and the weak force. But the complex math behind the theory ran into problems because it sometimes produced infinite answers, like for the energy of a particle. That was obviously impossible and therefore meaningless.The calculations were also complex because they were based on “non-Abelian gauge theory,” in which a change in the sequence of operations performed on an equation, to change its form, also changes its result. (So, unlike in high school mathematics, in which a x b equals b x a, in non-Abelian gauge theory a x b sometimes does not equal b x a.)Working with a graduate student of his, Gerardus ’t Hooft, Dr. Veltman set out to solve the problem. They used a technique called renormalization, which allowed them to substitute experimental results for the calculations that produced infinite answers.To perform the calculations, Dr. Veltman and Dr. ’t Hooft used a computer program that Dr. Veltman had written called Schoonschip, which is Dutch for “to clean or clear things up.” Dr. Veltman would later joke that he chose the name partly to annoy people who could not speak Dutch.Dr. Veltman and Dr. ’t Hooft were successful in solving the problems with the electroweak theory, establishing that electromagnetism and the weak force are, in fact, manifestations of the same force at high energy levels. Their work supported the prediction that two previously unknown fundamental particles, the W and Z bosons, would be found, helping to fill out missing elements of the Standard Model.Dr. Glashow, Dr. Weinberg and Dr. Salam were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979 for developing the electroweak theory, and Dr. Veltman and Dr. ’t Hooft shared the prize in 1999 for their contribution.Dr. Glashow said that Dr. Veltman and Dr. ’t Hooft’s work was invaluable. “Without the calculational system they developed, no one would have taken the electroweak theory seriously,” he said.Martinus Justinus Godefriedus Veltman was born on June 27, 1931, in Waalwijk, Netherlands. He was the fourth of six children. His father was the head of a primary school; one of Martinus’s brothers and two of his sisters became primary-school teachers.Occupying German troops in 1940 took over the father’s school. Though the town was liberated in 1944, the north of the Netherlands continued to be occupied, and Waalwijk was located close to the front line. In his Nobel biography, Dr. Martinus recalled that V-1 bombs fell on the town, with one landing on a house only 100 yards from his own, killing its inhabitants.Dr. Veltman was a so-so student, barely passing his final high school exam, but a high school teacher thought that he showed promise and urged his parents to send him to a university. He attended the University of Utrecht, commuting 90 minutes each way.Dr. Veltman found the education at Utrecht, which had lost many of its best professors during the war, uninspiring. He had to work on the side to pay his way through college, and it took him five years to finish his degree, two more than the usual undergraduate career. But then he stumbled on a book about Einstein’s theory of relativity and became fascinated by physics. He decided to pursue a Ph.D. at Utrecht.About that time the Belgian physicist Léon Van Hove arrived at the university and became Dr. Veltman’s adviser. After a two-year military stint, Dr. Veltman completed his doctorate.Dr. Van Hove left Utrecht in 1960 to become director of the theory division at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva. Dr. Veltman followed him a year later.Dr. Veltman spent a year at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University in 1963 before returning to CERN. He worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island in 1966 and was then hired by his alma mater, filling the post at Utrecht that Dr. Van Hove had occupied.In 1979, Dr. Veltman received an invitation to teach for a year at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. At the end of the appointment, he was hired to fill the John T. and Catherine T. MacArthur chair at the university. He stayed until his retirement in 1996, when he and his wife returned to the Netherlands.In 2003, he published a book about physics for the lay person called “Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics.”He is survived by his wife, Anneke, and their three children, Hélène, Hugo and Martijn.Dr. Veltman had an easygoing approach to physics. His Nobel lecture proceeded through the elements and history of particle physics using simple words and humor. Indeed, his humor was often sly. During a question-and-answer session after a lecture at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings in 2019, he was asked what made him like a theory.“The answer is trivial,” he said. “It has to work.”</body>

	<title>Progressives are mad at Biden for his potential pick for banking regulator.</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>Michael S. Barr, a law professor and former official in the Obama administration, is President Biden’s leading choice to become comptroller of the currency, a highly influential post that regulates banks.As an assistant Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, Mr. Barr helped shape the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform law, a sweeping regulatory act that subjects financial firms to stricter government oversight, a résumé bullet point that appears to certify him as a reformer.Progressives, however, are less enamored, Emily Flitter writes in The New York Times. Some have pointed to Mr. Barr’s efforts to ease some of Dodd-Frank’s restrictions, such as the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from using customer money to make their own bets on the markets, as evidence that he might be more friendly to business.His recent ties to the financial community, including advising a trade group that tries to influence legislators on behalf of fintech companies, have also come under scrutiny.Several progressive groups have expressed support for a different candidate: Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor who has studied the inequitable treatment that Black and poor people often receive from banks. One supporter of Ms. Baradaran even threatened to go on a hunger strike should Mr. Barr win the nomination.The explosion in cryptocurrency and online banking has raised the stakes of the regulatory role. Fintech firms are lobbying for banking charters, and the wider circulation of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will draw more regulatory review.</body>

	<title>This M.L.K. Day, America Has a ‘Long Road Ahead’</title>
	<author>Giovanni Russonello</author>
	<body>On Jan. 5, exactly 10 days before what would have been the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 92nd birthday, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of King’s former church, won election to become Georgia’s first Black senator.As The Associated Press officially called the race in the wee hours of the next morning, pundits on TV hailed the moment as a long-awaited milestone, half a century after Jim Crow had been evicted from the Deep South.But then, just 12 hours later, those channels were flooded with images of Trump supporters smashing their way into the Capitol building. It was hard to miss the stark symbolism of the push-and-pull: President Trump’s high-profile attempt to overturn his loss in Georgia and other states had helped bring these rioters to the Capitol — and Warnock’s victory only seemed to add fuel to their fire.“It’s something people of color are fairly accustomed to in the United States: these moments of progress, moments of advance, that always seem to be tempered by these moments of backlash,” Hakeem Jefferson, a political scientist at Stanford University who studies race and democracy, said in an interview.In a sense, the Capitol riot can be seen as a collision of two main pillars of Trump’s political messaging: disinformation and racial resentment. And in fact, history suggests that they go hand in hand.James Baldwin often pointed out that since white supremacy is a myth, it requires lies to uphold it. “Because they think they are white, they do not dare confront the ravage and the lie of their history,” he wrote in his essay “On Being White and Other Lies.” “Because they think they are white, they cannot allow themselves to be tormented by the suspicion that all men are brothers.”Just over a century ago, during the Red Summer of 1919, a rash of anti-Black riots broke out in cities across the country, driven by a similar cocktail of unsubstantiated and often baldly false claims (frequently about crimes by Black people) and thinly veiled white fears about threats to their own political power in cities.Today, as we officially celebrate King’s birthday, Jefferson views Trump’s alternate-reality politics as embodying the very same commitment that Baldwin talked about: to “whiteness as a kind of fantasy,” he said.“I think what we saw at the Capitol is a culmination of a kind of white grievance politics that the president has stoked for four years, and even before, as an original birther,” Jefferson said. “It’s this imagined world where whiteness is without competition.”Reeling from the attack on the Capitol, Joe Biden and other politicians have insisted that the violence does not represent “who we are” as a nation, pledging to bring the country together under shared ideals and to reject Trump’s divisiveness once and for all.But writing last week in The Undefeated, the critic Soraya Nadia McDonald took issue with the president-elect’s insistence that the country’s true identity had nothing to do with what happened on Jan. 6. “I’ve long found these sorts of proclamations baffling, because if one is honest about the history of the United States, it prominently features white violence, terrorism and revanchism, particularly toward Black people, Indigenous people and women,” McDonald wrote.This calls up King’s own words about America’s commitment to mythmaking. It’s not just extremists and self-proclaimed white supremacists who engage in this practice, the civil rights leader said.“Negroes have proceeded from a premise that equality means what it says, and they have taken white Americans at their word when they talked of it as an objective,” King wrote in his 1967 book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?” White Americans, however, often think of equality as “a loose expression for improvement,” King wrote. When it comes to the gap between Black and white prosperity, white America “seeks only to make it less painful and less obvious but in most respects to retain it.”Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Certainly, Biden often speaks in concrete terms about his expansive plans to invest in Black wealth generation, overhauling the criminal justice system and combating environmental racism. He and Kamala Harris, the vice president-elect, have in fact been more willing than arguably any other presidential ticket in history to speak explicitly about their plans to address systemic inequality, from an economic and a social perspective.But along the way, they will also have to confront America’s addiction to its oldest myths — and the ways that its newest technologies keep them alive and evolving.In the days since Jan. 6, right-wing broadcasters and social media voices have begun to push a false narrative of what happened at the Capitol, blaming the riot on left-wing groups and Black Lives Matter activists. Of course, no evidence of this has emerged, and the intruders had zealously made clear their intentions to overturn the result of the presidential election.But if these events are a reminder of anything, it’s that the fight for racial justice may be a two-front war, against both inequality and disinformation. Because it’s not only conspiracy theories that are circulating unchecked on social media; it’s also lowest-common-denominator content that caters to voters’ basest fears and prejudices. And it’s likely to continue as long as information is delivered through a basically unregulated marketplace of online platforms.“We have people who believe — I think sincerely — that this was brought on by antifa and Black Lives Matter,” Jefferson said of the Capitol attack. “If we can get a subset of America that believes that incredible lie, it’s a sign of how bad this all is.”“These circumstances are going to make it incredibly challenging for Biden to do what he sincerely says he wants to do, which is to bring the country together,” Jefferson added. “I think we’re in for a long road ahead.”On Politics is also available as a newsletter.

	<title>Pelosi increases pressure on Pentagon, saying Trump loyalist isn’t qualified to be the N.S.A.’s top lawyer.</title>
	<author>Julian E. Barnes</author>
	<body>Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote a letter to the acting secretary of defense demanding that he not install a Trump loyalist as the top lawyer at the National Security Agency, her office announced Monday.The action by Ms. Pelosi increases the pressure on the Pentagon to change course and not install Michael Ellis in an important Civil Service job within the intelligence community. It also increases the likelihood that the Biden administration will move Mr. Ellis out of the job, if the Pentagon pushes through with their plans to swear him in on Tuesday.In the letter, which was sent Sunday after a phone call between Ms. Pelosi and Christopher C. Miller, the acting defense secretary, the speaker said that Mr. Ellis was not qualified for the position of general counsel of the National Security Agency. She requested an investigation of his appointment by the Pentagon inspector general. “The circumstances and timing — immediately after President Trump’s defeat in the election — of the selection of Mr. Ellis, and this eleventh-hour effort to push this placement in the last three days of this administration are highly suspect,” Ms. Pelosi wrote.The White House in November pressured the Pentagon general counsel to select Mr. Ellis for the job. He was one of three finalists, but was not the most highly ranked of the candidates, according to people familiar with the process.The National Security Agency was moving forward getting the proper authorizations for Mr. Ellis, and new security clearances. But Mr. Miller, frustrated by what he saw as the agency’s slow-rolling of the process, ordered Mr. Ellis installed on Saturday.On Sunday, the National Security Agency announced they had given Mr. Ellis his final job offer. He is set to begin his position Tuesday, the final full day of the Trump administration. Because he has Civil Service protection, Mr. Ellis cannot be easily fired by the Biden administration, although he could be moved to another, less important position.The National Security Agency on Monday referred questions to the Pentagon. A Pentagon spokesman said they would not comment on communication between members of Congress and department leaders. A senior defense official said that Congressional interest in a hiring decision is not justification to delay placing a qualified person in a post.Ms. Pelosi said Mr. Ellis is a relatively recent law school graduate and does not have enough experience for the job. In addition to his selection over more qualified career officials, Ms. Pelosi wrote that his work as a lawyer for the National Security Council troubled her.“Mr. Ellis has been reportedly involved in highly questionable activities that are disqualifying,” Ms. Pelosi said.</body>

	<title>Do You Talk to Your Family About the Cost of College?</title>
	<author>Shannon Doyne</author>
	<body>Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021.Do you plan to go to college? Do you have a sense of how much one year of college might cost? If not, take a moment to look up the cost of tuition, room and board and various fees for a college that interests you. Have you seen older siblings, other relatives or friends go through the college application process? Are you a high school senior somewhere in the middle of the process? What do you know about applying for and seeking out aid to pay for your education? Do you and your parents or guardians ever talk about how to pay for college and whether they might be able to help you cover the cost? Do you think parents and their children should have honest conversations about the cost of college?  In “High School Grades Could Be Worth $100,000. Time to Tell Your Child?” Ron Lieber advises parents to have the kinds of conversations that would enable students to answer the questions above about financing their college educations. The article begins:Financial aid is no longer just about what you earn and what you have. It’s also about your children and what they do — and that means that good grades can be worth a whole lot of money.In the past quarter-century, an ever-growing number of schools — both public and private — have begun using aid as a weapon to try to increase their institutional prestige. In many cases, it is bait for students who can raise the school’s profile in the eyes of the rankings overlords at places like U.S. News &amp; World Report. In others, it’s become so rampant that discounts are necessary just to keep heads in the beds and pay the light bill.It goes by the name merit aid, and it’s not the same as the more limited academic scholarships of a generation ago. Now, admissions officers often report to bosses with the words “enrollment management” in their titles, and they can spread the money around much more broadly.“Aid” is a bit of a misnomer, albeit one that we seem to be stuck with. It’s not a scholarship as much as it is a coupon in many cases, one whose value may depend on applicants’ traits ranging from their ZIP code (which can signal affluence) to how quickly they open an email invitation.But the merit part — actual academic and leadership prowess — can also matter plenty. That means that grades aren’t just a factor in getting into a first-choice school, but also in what you might pay for a residential undergraduate education.The result is an elaborate parallel financial aid system that can totally upend the psychology of picking a college.And because nearly all but the most selective schools now use merit aid at least a little, list prices are increasingly irrelevant for most families. Classrooms at public institutions like the Universities of Delaware or South Carolina and private ones like Occidental College in Los Angeles or Syracuse in New York State have become more like airplane cabins, where people often pay many different amounts via extensive menus of possible prices.Over several years on the road talking to scores of college presidents, faculty members, enrollment deans and families about what we all should be willing to pay for college, I’ve learned how much of a head trip the merit aid system has become.And just like drugs, you should talk to your kid about it before someone else does.Mr. Lieber suggests how and when parents and their children should start talking about paying for college:If you haven’t been talking about money all along, a basic conversation may be in order first, to prepare teenagers to take it all in. Roughly how much money have you saved for college, if any, and how much do you make? You would need to put this on financial aid forms, in any event.Then, this: What are you willing to pay for college, and where? This is, alas, just as complex of a topic as the pricing system itself. Be ready to explain why you intend to limit it to a certain amount of money (if any) or particular types of schools (ditto).Now, about the timing. It seems only fair that teenagers ought to know the rules of engagement at the beginning of the game. After all, many teens would be furious if you held this information back because you thought that they couldn’t handle the truth.So one possibility is this: Have a brief but deliberate merit aid conversation two months into the summer after eighth grade.It does not have to be an extended chat if a child seems reasonably motivated already. You might simply explain that grades don’t just count for admission these days — good ones can make many expensive schools more affordable. That way, rising high school freshmen can begin to consider what sort of marks they’ll need to achieve and other extracurricular goals they might want to set.Wait any longer than the start of high school, and the vicious math of grade point averages may not allow them to catch up if they are aiming for merit aid at more selective institutions. And grades and curricular choices — unlike ZIP codes or other demographic information — are something that is mostly within a teenager’s control.Students, read the entire article, then tell us:Do you agree with Mr. Lieber that the summer before ninth grade is the right time to start a family conversation about paying for college? Why or why not? Have you started to talk about this topic at home? If yes, what have the conversations been like?The article quotes Ashley Darcy-Mahoney on the topic of being honest with children: “Most teenagers want to be treated like adults. And treating them that way, in giving them information about adulthood and adult decisions, is also what they want.” Respond to this quotation. Do you feel ready to know what role, if any, your family will play in financing your college education? What, if anything, do you think Ms. Darcy-Mahoney isn’t taking into consideration here?How much stress do you feel about academics? Does the idea that merit aid is determined in part by your grades and test scores affect your motivation to do well in school? What, if anything, do you see yourself doing differently as a result of reading this article? Explain.What’s one thing you learned about merit aid and the cost of college? What’s one thing that frustrated you when you read this article? What’s one question you now have about the college application process?About Student Opinion• Find all of our Student Opinion questions in this column. • Have an idea for a Student Opinion question?

	<title>Are We Ready for a Monday Without Trump?</title>
	<author>Bret Stephens</author>
	<body>Bret Stephens: Gail, I know we should be forward-looking and positive. But as you cast a final glance at the Trump administration’s final hours, what will you remember most fondly: Melania’s last “Be Best” address or the president marching off to the tune of The Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.”?Gail Collins: I don’t think most Americans have strong feelings about Melania one way or the other. Obviously, she does have a son to support. I’d maybe have been a fan if the two of them left Mar-a-Lago and started a business grooming collies or something.Bret: Count me as one American who found her tour as first lady bizarre. I kept waiting for Derek Zoolander to make an appearance in the White House and paint the Oval Office mauve. Sorry, go on.Gail: As it was, I’m prepared to amiably ignore Melania — even if she becomes a guest judge on “America’s Got Talent.” As long as she ignores her evil husband, which seems to be something she’s pretty good at.Bret: What we need is a show called “America’s Got No Talent,” in which the immediate members of the Trump family are contestants for life.Gail: My question for you at this huge, enormous, change-of-course moment is: What will the public start thinking about? The Biden agenda? Donald Trump in exile? The next “Bachelorette”?Bret: The moment feels to me less like a new beginning than the final few miles of a marathon, when you’re in a world of pain but you know the finish line is close and you just have to will yourself toward it. I’m not a fan of some of President Biden’s executive orders, but it’s hard to focus on them when all most of us can think about is, “When will our parents get the shot?” “When can we dine indoors?” and “Will we ever get to enter a building without a mask again?”Gail: It’s true that the virus overshadows everything. Most of my conversations with friends seem to begin with “Have you gotten the vaccine yet?” It sort of reminds me of senior year in high school when someone runs into the room and yells “I got into Yale!” The response would be a mixture of genuine pleasure and bitter jealousy.Bret: Know the feeling. As for Biden, that magnificent inaugural address was a good start. We desperately need a more civil national dialogue. In that sense, putting immigration reform at the head of his legislative agenda is a smart move. It’s humane, it’s good for America’s long-term demographic health and it’s good for business, too.Gail: Part of me still nurtures the tendency to sort of shudder when someone does something sorta noble, and the commentators announce it’ll be good for business.Bret: Good point. I meant, good for the economy: Immigrants start new companies at about twice the rate of the native-born. An immigration bill will be even more important if Biden can peel off Republican support, even if he has to do it in exchange for building a few more miles of that wall. If that’s the sort of compromise that can mollify the G.O.P. while giving hope to millions of undocumented workers, it’s worth it.Gail: If he built a genuine wall he’d be out-walling the last administration. Maybe I could live with a Trump-type stretch that’s actually just a sometimes shoddy expansion of the fence that’s already there.Bret: Then again, we still have the unfinished business of Trump’s trial in the Senate. What do you make of the delay?Gail: Once again I’m torn between passion and practicality. I so, so, so want to see Trump convicted, barred from politics forever and placed firmly on the bottom rung of the American presidency.Bret: He’s there already, as the political equivalent of Richard Nixon’s footstool, Herbert Hoover’s bath slippers and James Buchanan’s spittoon.Gail: On the other hand, I understand Biden wanting to get some of his big agenda items done right off the bat, while he’s still brand-new and popular. I guess if I had to flat-out choose, I’d put fighting Covid and fixing the economy above further humiliation and denigration for Trump. But it certainly wouldn’t satisfy me emotionally.Bret: So now I might be on your left. Trump needs to be convicted. If he isn’t, not only does it make Trump’s political resurrection possible, it also means the Congress won’t defend its institutional prerogatives to sanction an assault against it, making it more likely to happen in the future. I’d also like to see every single Republican senator be forced to cast a vote. I keep hearing some of my conservative friends saying that what Trump did was impeachable but a trial won’t serve the country’s interests. Somehow I don’t remember that being the line back when Bill Clinton was in the hot seat.Gail: Well, I can’t let you be lounging around on my left at this critical moment in the nation’s history. Absolutely no question the Senate should take up the impeachment. Just would prefer to put it a little down the line, behind Covid and the economy.Bret: Switching topics for a sec, Gail, I’ve been pondering how much journalism has changed in the past four or five years. For all of his venom — or, rather, because of it — Trump was very good for the news business.Gail: You know, in the old days, whenever something terrible would happen — fire, flood, multiple homicide — a sage veteran in the newsroom would try to cheer us up by saying: “Well, it’s good for business.”Bret: But I also think he made the profession more adversarial, more ideological, more partisan. What’s your view?Gail: We’ve been stuck in a situation in which “the president lied” is a factual description of something that occurred on a daily — sometimes hourly — basis. But the news side of our paper and others have struggled mightily to give a crazy, unmanaged, unprofessional White House serious, nonpartisan coverage.Bret: Calling Trump out on his lies and outrages was essential. But — and I’m speaking of the mainstream media in general here — too many pejorative adjectives slipped into the coverage, at least for my taste. Whatever happened to showing rather than telling?Gail: I’d say that much of the media was at times rather valiant in resisting readers’ demands that stories all reflect their horror at what the country was coming down to.But Trump is a warning that in the digital universe, we’re going to need new rules for the future.Bret: One rule should be that if it sounds too good to be true (hello, Moscow pee tapes), it probably is. Too much of the media slipped down one rabbit hole too many when it came to Trump, especially when it concerned conspiracy theories involving Russia. I think the dry hole that was Russiagate created a well of public distrust that will take years for our profession to overcome.Then again, I recently told a college graduate that there has never been a better time to get into our business.Gail: Once again, we’re ending our argument in agreement. Absolutely with you on this fabulous vocation.Bret: Every time I look at some of the visual journalism The Times does — especially when it comes to transforming data into visuals (or vice versa) — I marvel at how far the profession has come since I started, 26 years ago. And the importance of producing well-written, well-vetted, well-edited and well-presented journalism in our new age of fake news and deep fakes has never been more crucial.Gail: Or more fun.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Wall Street Returns to Riyadh</title>
	<author>Ephrat Livni</author>
	<body>It’s been more than two years since bankers kept their name badges obscured behind ties at a high-profile investment conference in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, held weeks after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents at the country’s consulate in Istanbul. After a wave of cancellations at the 2018 event, the next year’s Future Investment Initiative, often called “Davos in the Desert,” saw many business leaders attend as the immediate furor over the killing subsided.The next installment of the conference begins in Riyadh on Wednesday, and even more — and more senior — executives are expected to appear, both virtually and in person. It raises the question: Is there a statute of limitations in associating with a country accused of human rights abuses?Who’s going: Some of Wall Street’s biggest names are scheduled to attend, mostly virtually, according to the conference’s itinerary. David Rubenstein of Carlyle is moderating a keynote panel that also includes Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, Larry Fink of BlackRock, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs and Thomas Gottstein of Credit Suisse. James Gorman of Morgan Stanley will be interviewed by the CNN anchor Erin Burnett. Other executives set to appear are Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Masa Son of SoftBank, Adena Friedman of Nasdaq, Tom Barrack of Colony Capital and Jeffrey Ubben of Inclusive Capital.In 2019, Morgan Stanley and Goldman sent lower-ranking execs to the conference, not their C.E.O.s.A possible morality test for business in a new administration. Joe Biden called Saudi Arabia a “pariah” on the campaign trail, and, while the new president may not drastically disrupt relations with the country — whose support he may need to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal — “the atmospherics are going to change,” said Gregory Gause of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University. On Friday, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, asked for declassification of a U.S. government report on the Khashoggi killing.What companies are saying. Companies contacted by DealBook pointed to the important business relationships they have with cash-rich Saudi Arabia and others in the region. Some of those ties are long established — Nasdaq has partnered with the Saudi stock exchange for two decades — while others are related to the kingdom’s more recent efforts to diversify its economy beyond oil.A representative for BlackRock said that Mr. Fink “has been very public about the need for continued reform in Saudi Arabia and believes that engagement and public dialogue by global leaders like himself can help encourage Saudi Arabia’s path of reform.”“We have long standing clients in the region and continue to serve them,” a Goldman spokesman said.Representatives for Blackstone, Bridgewater, Carlyle, Nasdaq and Mr. Barrack declined to comment. Representatives for CNN, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, SoftBank and Mr. Ubben did not return requests for a comment.Legitimacy by association? “M.B.S. is going to be running Saudi Arabia no matter what David Solomon says or doesn’t say,” Mr. Gause of Texas A&amp;M said, referring to the nickname of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. He questioned the logic of withdrawing corporate ties from Saudi Arabia but keeping them in, say, China, which faces its own criticisms over human rights abuses.Thor Halvorssen, the founder of the nonprofit Human Rights Foundation, which has funded “The Dissident,” a documentary about Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, said that those attending the event gave the crown prince valuable legitimacy. “The message is, ‘Look, the world’s money and the powerhouses of finance and industry are my puppets,’” he said.President Biden unveils a “Buy American” executive order. The action strengthens requirements for government contracts to buy domestic products. America’s trade partners will be watching to see how that meshes with Mr. Biden’s efforts to unwind the Trump trade wars.A bipartisan group of lawmakers pushes back against the Biden stimulus bill. Centrists from both parties yesterday pushed the National Economic Council’s director, Brian Deese, to limit the $1.9 trillion bill’s scope. Among their concerns was whether a proposed $1,400 in direct payments could be restricted to the neediest Americans.The virtual World Economic Forum begins today. More than 1,200 leaders from business, government and more will gather this week online — instead of at the meeting’s usual home in Davos, Switzerland — to discuss the theme, a “Crucial Year to Rebuild Trust.” The headline speaker today: President Xi Jinping of China.Frenzy in options trading sends stocks soaring. Shares in the Chinese internet giant Tencent jumped 11 percent today, its biggest gain in nearly a decade, as Hong Kong traders snapped up call options en masse. And shares in the video game retailer GameStop soared more than 50 percent on relentless retail option buying.Elon Musk’s new project is … drilling for natural gas. His SpaceX rocket company plans to sink wells near its launchpad in Texas, Bloomberg reports. It’s unclear why, but Bloomberg notes that SpaceX’s rocket engines will use supercold liquid methane.Taboola, one of the biggest purveyors of so-called chumbox ads — the collections of attention-grabbing links at the bottom of web pages — announced today that it would go public by merging with a blank-check fund at a $2.6 billion valuation, The Times’s Michael de la Merced and Tiffany Hsu report.The move is Taboola’s Plan B, after its attempt to merge with its archrival, Outbrain, fell apart. The two called off their deal in September, amid the pandemic and lengthy antitrust reviews. Taboola’s C.E.O., Adam Singolda, said that, shortly after the merger’s collapse, he began talking with the Israeli financier Gilad Shany, who had recently raised $259 million for a SPAC and was seeking to buy another Israeli business “to build a global player.”Today’s deal fulfills an ambition of Mr. Singolda’s — “I always wanted to go public,” he said — with $285 million in additional investment from the likes of Fidelity, BlackRock and the frequent SPAC investor Hedosophia.Being public will help Taboola strike more deals, Mr. Singolda said. Taboola generated $100 million in pro forma earnings last year and has $375 million in net revenue. But having a public stock as currency could help the company buy additional businesses to expand in areas like e-commerce. “We think this can be five times the size it is today,” said Mr. Shany, who will join Taboola’s board.It’s the latest deal involving a SPAC, one of Wall Street’s hottest trends, as private companies increasingly seek out the deal vehicles to join the stock markets without the hassle of a traditional I.P.O. process.In more SPAC news: A blank-check fund run by Tishman Speyer, the real-estate investment firm, will merge with the keyless-door-entry company Latch at a valuation of more than $1 billion. And Alight, a provider of H.R. services, is reportedly near a deal to merge with a SPAC at a $7.3 billion valuation. SPACs have raised nearly $20 billion so far just this month, already more than in any full year before 2020.— Dr. Anthony Fauci, in an eye-opening interview with The Times about his time advising the Trump White House on the Covid-19 pandemic.Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, recently disclosed that her husband, the investor Paul Pelosi, bought stock options last month in Apple, Disney and Tesla and purchased shares of AllianceBernstein, valued at $1.75 million to $3.5 million in all. Her disclosure form attests that the trades did not rely on insider information, but as DealBook has written, the activity highlights why more transparency around lawmaker-associated trading of individual company stocks could benefit the public and the officials involved.Lots of investors are buying Tesla, and it’s no secret that electric vehicles figure in the Biden administration’s expansive environmental plans. But the Pelosis aren’t average investors, because Ms. Pelosi has an outsize influence on policy. The Tesla trade, which cost between $500,000 and $1 million, was smart but not necessarily suspect, given the enthusiasm that investors have for the company, experts told DealBook. Tesla’s shares have risen more than 600 percent over the past year. (The Tesla trade first came to our attention via Congress Trading.)Ms. Pelosi is among the wealthiest members of a millionaire-rich Congress; she was worth nearly $115 million in 2018. Much of that wealth was generated by her low-profile financier husband and a stock portfolio that has positions in many big corporate names, according to disclosure forms. The couple’s son, Paul Pelosi Jr., is a lawyer who has worked on sustainability and corporate governance in the public and private sectors; he was recently named a director at EVSX and an adviser to Altair International, both of which are involved in battery technology for electric vehicles.“There ought to be more sunlight on the people who trade in Congress,” the former S.E.C. chairman Harvey L. Pitt told Andrew recently. A possible rule Andrew discussed would require broker-dealers to get “politically exposed persons” to answer a questionnaire within 24 hours of a trade. Ms. Pelosi did not respond to DealBook’s requests for comment on the proposal.DealsKuaishou, a Chinese rival to TikTok, is reportedly set to raise more than $5 billion in its I.P.O. in Hong Kong, at a valuation above $60 billion.

	<title>Giuliani will not be part of Trump’s defense in the Senate impeachment trial.</title>
	<author>Maggie Haberman</author>
	<body>President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, will not be taking part in the president’s defense in the Senate trial for his second impeachment, a person close to Mr. Trump said on Monday.Mr. Trump met with Mr. Giuliani on Saturday night at the White House, and the next day the president began telling people that Mr. Giuliani was not going to be part of the team. It is unclear who will be the defense lawyer for Mr. Trump, given that many attorneys have privately said they won’t represent him.Mr. Giuliani himself at first said he was taking part in the trial and then a day later said he had no involvement.He told ABC News on Sunday that he would not be part of the defense, noting that he is a potential witness since he gave a speech at the rally on Jan. 6 of Trump supporters who went on to storm the Capitol complex, overtaking it for hours.Yet a day earlier, Mr. Giuliani told ABC News that he would in fact be involved in the impeachment defense, and left open the possibility of Mr. Trump showing up for the trial. That interview infuriated Trump advisers and was a bridge too far for the president himself, according to the person close to the president, who described personal conversations on condition of anonymity.While the president has a decades-long relationship with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s advisers blame him for the events surrounding both of the impeachments that the president has faced.</body>

	<title>Tennessee Fires Football Coach Amid Investigation</title>
	<author>Gillian R. Brassil</author>
	<body>The University of Tennessee fired Jeremy Pruitt, its head football coach, and nine other staff members after the school investigated whether the program violated N.C.A.A. recruitment regulations, the school announced Monday.The firings go into effect on Tuesday.In November, the university started an investigation in collaboration with a law firm, Bond, Schoeneck &amp; King, to determine if the football program had broken N.C.A.A. rules while recruiting candidates for its team, finding that “Coach Pruitt did not meet the university’s expectations for promoting an atmosphere of compliance and/or monitoring the activities of the coaches and staff who report to him.”Among those fired were assistant football coaches Brian Niedermeyer and Shelton Felton, four members of the football team’s on-campus recruitment staff, the director and assistant director of football player personnel, and a football quality control coach.“What is so disturbing, as demonstrated by the scope of these actions, is the number of violations and people involved and their efforts to conceal their activities from our compliance staff and from the Athletic department’s leaders,” Donde Plowman, the school’s chancellor, said in a news release. “Despite a strong compliance culture in our athletic department, we must look for ways to further strengthen our processes.”Tennessee informed the N.C.A.A. about the violations, and the university opened its own case in December, Plowman said in a news conference on Monday. She did not cite specific violations, because both the school’s investigation and N.C.A.A.’s case are ongoing, but said that there were likely a “significant number” of Level I and Level II violations. Level I violations are considered “severe” breaches of conduct, including fraud and unethical conduct that signals a “lack of institutional control.” Level II is considered “significant.”Pruitt, 46, was hired in December 2017 and had a 16-19 record in three seasons. He went 3-7 this year as Tennessee exclusively played within its league, the Southeastern Conference, amid the coronavirus pandemic.The university, claiming for-cause firing, will not pay Pruitt any of his estimated $12.6 million buyout; it will also not pay Niedermeyer or Felton their buyouts.In a statement released Monday night, Pruitt’s lawyer, Michael Lyons, said that the nature of the firing showed the university’s effort to get rid of him without paying the buyout despite minimal evidence that Pruitt had violated N.C.A.A. regulations. Lyons claimed that in a private meeting between Pruitt and Plowman, Plowman said that “there was no evidence that Coach Pruitt was either actively involved in any alleged violations or knew they were occurring.” Lyons also said that Pruitt received the letter of termination three hours after Plowman said no employment decisions had been made.“The timing of the University’s actions and decision appear to be preordained and more about financial convenience and expediency than a fair and complete factual determination by the University,” Lyons wrote.He added that he would defend Pruitt against any violations he is accused of by the N.C.A.A. and look into whether the university intended to “disparage and destroy Coach Pruitt’s reputation” to back out of payments that he would be owed for a regular release.Several current and former Tennessee players and former players posted their surprise of Pruitt’s firing on Twitter.“Crazy,” wrote defensive tackle Omari Thomas.“Why,” wrote quarterback Brian Maurer.The university’s athletic director, Phillip Fulmer, also announced that he would retire as soon as the school found a replacement for him. Fulmer, 70, came out of retirement in 2017 to oversee athletics at the school in Knoxville, Tenn., on a “short-term basis,” according to the announcement. The university said that the search for Fulmer’s replacement will begin immediately and that the new athletic director would hire the new football coach.“Our next football coach needs to be on the sidelines for 10 years or more, and he will need to know who his athletic director will be for the duration,” Fulmer said. “It only makes sense that I make this move now, so a new coach and a new athletic director can implement their vision together.”Plowman said that Fulmer was not involved in any of the potential recruiting violations. Pruitt’s firing means Tennessee will be hiring its fifth different full-time coach since Fulmer stopped coaching in 2008.Kevin Steele, the team’s newly hired defensive assistant, will serve as the interim head coach.“This is very unfortunate in the sense that we’re going to have to work really hard to keep it from setting us back,” Fulmer said at the news conference.</body>

	<title>The Wreckage Betsy DeVos Leaves Behind</title>
	<author>The Editorial Board</author>
	<body>The departing education secretary, Betsy DeVos, will be remembered as perhaps the most disastrous leader in the Education Department’s history. Her lack of vision has been apparent in a variety of contexts, but never more so than this fall when she told districts that were seeking guidance on how to operate during the coronavirus pandemic that it was not her responsibility to track school district infection rates or keep track of school reopening plans. This telling remark implies a vision of the Education Department as a mere bystander in a crisis that disrupted the lives of more than 50 million schoolchildren.If the Senate confirms President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee, Miguel Cardona, as Ms. DeVos’s successor, he will face the herculean task of clearing away the wreckage left by his predecessor — while helping the states find a safe and equitable path to reopening schools.Beyond that, the new secretary needs to quickly reverse a range of corrosive DeVos-era policies, including initiatives that rolled back civil rights protections for minority children as well as actions that turned the department into a subsidiary of predatory for-profit colleges that saddle students with crushing debt while granting them useless degrees.There is still more to learn about Mr. Cardona. But at first glance, the contrast between him and his predecessor is striking. Ms. DeVos had almost no experience in public education and was clearly uninterested in the department’s mission. Mr. Cardona worked his way up from teacher to principal to education commissioner of Connecticut. Moreover, he seems to understand that a big part of his job involves using the bully pulpit to advance policies that benefit all schoolchildren and protect the most vulnerable.Mr. Cardona would need to pay close attention to how districts plan to deal with learning loss that many children will suffer while the schools are closed. Fall testing data analyzed by the nonprofit research organization NWEA suggests that setbacks have been less severe than were feared, with students showing continued academic progress in reading and only modest setbacks in math.However, given a shortage of testing data for Black, Hispanic and poor children, it could well be that these groups have fared worse in the pandemic than their white or more affluent peers. The country needs specific information on how these subgroups are doing so that it can allocate educational resources strategically.Beyond that, parents need to know where their children stand after such a sustained period without much face-to-face instruction. Given these realities, the new education secretary — whoever he or she turns out to be — should resist calls to put off annual student testing.Research has long since shown that a summer vacation can wipe out a month or two of student learning. Making up for an even more serious learning shortfall will require planning that should begin now. An obvious first step would be to use the summer of 2021 for summer school or catch-up tutoring. If the Biden Education Department decides on this approach, it will need to petition Congress to fund the project. The states are too cash poor at the moment and could not undertake such a venture on their own.The Education Department should also recognize that this pandemic will not be the last one. That means developing a list of best practices and strategic schools plans that can be swiftly rolled out when another medical crisis occurs with a different infectious agent.In addition to addressing worrisome matters like these, the new education commissioner needs to revoke a series of department communiqués that had the effect of letting school districts off the hook for discriminatory disciplinary practices and other potential violations of civil rights law. The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights exposed the depth of this problem during the Obama years, when it released data showing that excessively punitive policies were being used at every level of the public school system — and that even minority 4-year-olds were being disproportionately suspended and expelled.The new administration needs to underscore the message that these damaging practices are unacceptable. This means renewing civil rights guidance to school districts and opening investigations after credible reports of wrongdoing.The DeVos administration sold out to predatory for-profit colleges and their various abettors within a nanosecond of taking office. To get a jump on reversing this particular set of policies, the new education secretary can begin rule-making processes where necessary and inform the courts that it will no longer defend against lawsuits filed by state attorneys general and others who have dogged the DeVos department in court for buddying up to the for-profit industry and attacking student borrowers who deserve to have their student loans forgiven because they were defrauded by career education programs.The department should immediately begin rule-making to reverse Ms. DeVos’s gutting of the “gainful employment” rule, which was supposed to cut off access to federal student aid for career training programs that buried students in debt while failing to prepare them for the job market.Pending in court is a lawsuit filed by 22 states and the District of Columbia charging that Ms. DeVos unlawfully rescinded an Obama-era rule that allowed students who had been defrauded by career colleges to have their federal loans forgiven. The department should stop defending against this lawsuit and revisit loan discharge claims by borrowers who remain saddled with debt even though the schools they attended were shown to be engaged in fraud. The DeVos version of the so-called borrower defense rule was so onerous for defrauded borrowers that Congress passed a bipartisan measure blocking it. That measure, however, was vetoed by the president.In yet another sop to the for-profit industry, Ms. DeVos disregarded a scathing indictment by her department’s career staff, reinstating an accrediting body that had been stripped of its authority for exercising lax oversight. The organization was the accreditor for two for-profit institutions that collapsed, leaving tens of thousands of students with debt and useless degrees. The new education secretary would do well to closely scrutinize the department’s methodology for evaluating accreditors.Yet another set of lawsuits has shown how the companies that are handsomely paid to collect student loans aggravate the debt crisis by giving advice that costs borrowers money while earning the companies cash.The Department of Education lies in ruins at precisely the time when the country most needs it. The president-elect and his new education secretary, whoever that turns out to be, need to get the institution up and running as swiftly as possible.

	<title>Debating Stimulus Checks</title>
	<author>David Leonhardt</author>
	<body>Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up.The idea to send $2,000 checks to most Americans began circulating in the spring, pushed by progressive Democrats like Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Pramila Jayapal. But the proposal has never fit into a neat ideological box.Some moderate Democrats also saw the checks as a good way to help people during the pandemic. And some Republicans liked that the checks went directly to Americans, rather than being filtered through a government program. By the end of last year, Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican senator, and President Donald Trump were backing the idea, as well.The checks have since become a centerpiece of President Biden’s coronavirus response plan, accounting for $465 billion of his proposed $1.9 trillion in spending. Polls show that the idea is popular.And yet some economists — and politicians, in both parties — have deep reservations. Today, I want to lay out three main arguments both for and against the idea, based on my conversations with experts and people on Capitol Hill and in the Biden administration. I hope these points will help you decide what you think.First, the basic facts: Because the virus-response bill that passed in December included $600 checks, Biden is now proposing $1,400 checks, with bonuses for children. A typical family with two parents and three children could receive $4,600. Families making less than $150,000 a year would likely be eligible for the full amount.1. People need help. Almost 10 million fewer Americans are working now than when the pandemic began, and normal life is still months from returning. “Doing too little has enormous downside cost,” Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told me.Many households are also coping with the long-term effects of slow-growing incomes and wealth over the past four decades. The checks will let people decide for themselves how to spend the money — be it to cover medical expenses, pay tuition, save for retirement or buy a car. Much of this spending will stimulate the economy and create jobs.2. It’s simple. At a time when many people don’t trust the government, easy-to-understand policies can build trust. Matthew Yglesias, author of the Slow Boring newsletter, calls this the “does exactly what it says on the tin” principle. The Obama administration designed a complex stimulus program in 2009 and didn’t get much political credit for it. The Biden administration can heed this lesson.3. It’s surprisingly progressive. A $4,600 check means much more to a poor or working-class family than it does to an upper-middle-class family. (Very affluent families don’t qualify for the checks.)Consider this chart, which shows how the two rounds of pandemic checks that the government sent last year — equaling $1,800 combined for many people — affected after-tax incomes:The checks aren’t simply a stimulus program. They are an important part of Biden’s ambitious effort to fight poverty.1. Many people don’t need the money. The current recession is a strange one. Neither house prices nor stock prices have fallen — and many people’s expenses have declined — leaving most Americans financially better off than a year ago:As a result, many people will save the money the government sends them, which won’t help put other people back to work. “I think the checks are an abomination,” Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute told me.2. It’s possible to target the money. Biden’s stimulus could instead increase unemployment benefits even more than it now proposes. Or it could do more to help small businesses stay open. Or more to expand child care.3. F.D.R. wouldn’t have done it. Sending people money does little to address the country’s deepest problems — like climate change and the underlying causes of inequality. Those problems require coordinated government action. So why has Biden embraced an expensive, Trump-backed idea that’s basically a big tax cut?“I don’t ever remember F.D.R. recommending sending a damn penny to a human being. He gave ’em a job and gave ’em a paycheck,” Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, has said. “Can’t we start some infrastructure program to help people, get ’em back on their feet?”The checks will be a central part of the debate over Biden’s first virus bill. Many Senate Republicans oppose the checks, which means they may fall short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.In that case, Democrats would have to choose between altering their plan and passing the bill through a process known as reconciliation, which requires only 51 votes.West Virginia has become a leader in the U.S. vaccine rollout, using 83 percent of its allotted doses. But there still aren’t enough shots to go around.Millions more in the U.S. will get the virus unless people keep wearing masks and maintaining social distance in coming months. This scientific model shows why.Biden will ban travel from South Africa to contain a variant of the virus detected there. (U.S. citizens and permanent residents are exempt.) Biden will extend travel restrictions on other parts of the world, too, including Brazil and Europe.“They knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing back on it,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told The Times, referring to his time in the Trump administration. Here’s the interview.Mexico’s president is the latest world leader to contract the virus.The Miami Heat will screen fans at its arena with coronavirus-sniffing dogs, The Associated Press reported.It’s cold, it’s a pandemic, and New Yorkers are layering up and going out for meals.

The executive producer is an alum of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”Other popular recent shows on the platform include “Love Is Blind,” about dating; “Selling Sunset,” about high-end real estate; and “The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives.”As Yomi Adegoke writes in The Guardian, Netflix’s recent string of hits has helped cement its place as a competitor for reality-driven networks like Bravo.

	<title>Biden is expected to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline permit on his first day in office.</title>
	<author>Michael D. Shear</author>
	<body>President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline permit on his first day in office, quickly reversing his predecessor’s approval of a project to move oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, according to a person familiar with Mr. Biden’s plans for his first days in office.Environmentalists have long targeted the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline as both a contributor to climate change and a physical symbol of the country’s unwillingness to move away from an oil-based economy. Many Republicans, including President Trump, argued the pipeline would create jobs and help local economies.In late-2015, former President Barack Obama rejected the permit for the project, arguing it would undermine American leadership on the transition to sustainable fuels. Mr. Trump’s administration reversed that decision in early 2017, giving a green light for construction of the project to begin.Construction has hit other economic and legal roadblocks since then, but environmentalists were pleased when Mr. Biden said during the presidential campaign that he intended to once again cancel the permit.That is expected to happen on Jan. 20, amid a flurry of other executive actions that Mr. Biden plans to take to demonstrate his determination to reverse Mr. Trump’s legacy. Ending the Keystone project would send just such a signal.Had it been completed, the pipeline was designed to take as much as 830,000 barrels a day of Canadian and North Dakota crude to refineries in Texas and Louisiana for processing into oil that could be exported overseas or used to enhance domestic supplies.</body>

	<title>As Virus Grows Stealthier, Vaccine Makers Reconsider Battle Plans</title>
	<author>Katie Thomas</author>
	<body>As the coronavirus assumes contagious new forms around the world, two drug makers reported on Monday that their vaccines, while still effective, offer less protection against one variant and began revising plans to turn back an evolving pathogen that has killed more than two million people.The news from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech underscored a realization by scientists that the virus is changing more quickly than once thought, and may well continue to develop in ways that help it elude the vaccines being deployed worldwide. The announcements arrived even as President Biden banned travel to the United States from South Africa beginning on Saturday, in hopes of stanching the spread of one variant. And Merck, a leading drug company, on Monday abandoned two experimental coronavirus vaccines altogether, saying they did not produce a strong enough immune response against the original version of the virus.Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech both said their vaccines were effective against new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa. But they are slightly less protective against the variant in South Africa, which may be more adept at dodging antibodies in the bloodstream.The vaccines are the only ones authorized for emergency use in the United States.As a precaution, Moderna has begun developing a new form of its vaccine that could be used as a booster shot against the variant in South Africa. “We’re doing it today to be ahead of the curve, should we need to,” Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, said in an interview. “I think of it as an insurance policy.”“I don’t know if we need it, and I hope we don’t,” he added.Moderna said it also planned to begin testing whether giving patients a third shot of its original vaccine as a booster could help fend off newly emerging forms of the virus.Dr. Ugur Sahin, the chief executive of BioNTech, said in an interview on Monday that his company was talking to regulators around the world about what types of clinical trials and safety reviews would be required to authorize a new version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that would be better able to head off the variant in South Africa.Studies showing decreased levels of antibodies against a new variant do not mean a vaccine is proportionately less effective, Dr. Sahin said. BioNTech could develop a newly adjusted vaccine against the variants in about six weeks, he said. The Food and Drug Administration has not commented on what its policy will be for authorizing vaccines that have been updated to work better against new variants.But some scientists said that the adjusted vaccines should not have to go through the same level of scrutiny, including extensive clinical trials, that the original versions did. The influenza vaccine is updated each year to account for new strains without an extensive approval process.“The whole point of this is a rapid response to an emerging situation,” said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.Dr. Sahin said a similar booster shot eventually might be necessary to stop Covid-19. The vaccine’s reduced efficacy may also mean that more people would need to get the shots before the population achieves herd immunity.Scientists had predicted that the coronavirus would evolve and might acquire new mutations that would thwart vaccines, but few researchers expected it to happen so soon. Part of the problem is the sheer ubiquity of the pathogen.There have been nearly 100 million cases worldwide since the pandemic began, and each new infection gives the coronavirus more chances to mutate. Its uncontrolled spread has fueled the development of new forms that challenge human hosts in various ways.“The more people infected, the more likely that we will see new variants,” said Dr. Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York. “If we give the virus a chance to do its worst, it will.”Several variants have emerged with mutations that worry scientists. A form first detected in Britain is up to 50 percent more contagious than the virus identified in China a year ago, and researchers have begun to think that it may also be slightly more deadly.Researchers in South Africa identified another variant after doctors there discovered a jump in Covid-19 cases in October. They alerted the World Health Organization in early December that the variant seemed to have mutations that might make the virus less susceptible to vaccines.A variant found in Brazil has many of the mutations seen in the South African form, but genetic evidence suggests that the two variants evolved independently. Preliminary studies in the laboratory had hinted that those viruses may have some degree of resistance to the immunity that people develop after recovering from the infection or being inoculated with the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.The variant identified in Britain has been found in at least 20 states in the United States. The version found in South Africa has not been reported in this country, but on Monday health officials in Minnesota announced that they had documented the first case of infection with the Brazilian variant. It is far from certain that these are the only worrying variants out there. Few countries, including the United States, have invested in the kind of genetic surveillance needed to detect emerging variants. Britain leads the world in these efforts, sequencing of about 10 percent of its virus samples.The United States has analyzed less than 1 percent of its samples; officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this month that they expect to swiftly ramp up those efforts.Researchers at Moderna examined blood samples from eight people who had received two doses of the vaccine, and two monkeys that had been immunized. Neutralizing antibodies — the type that can disable the virus — were just as effective against the variant identified in Britain as they were against the original form of the virus.But with the variant circulating in South Africa, there was a sixfold reduction in the antibodies’ effectiveness. Even so, the company said, those antibodies “remain above levels that are expected to be protective.”The results have not been published or peer-reviewed, but were posted online at BioRxiv. Moderna collaborated on the study with the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health.Dr. Zaks said that the new version of the Moderna vaccine, aimed at the South African variant, could be used if needed as a booster one year after people received the original vaccine.The need for such a booster may be determined by blood tests to measure antibody levels or by watching the population of vaccinated people to see if they begin falling ill from the new variant.“We don’t yet have data on the Brazilian variant,” Dr. Zaks said. “Our expectation is that if anything it should be close to the South African one. That’s the one with the most overlap.” New forms of the virus will continue to emerge, he said, “and we’ll continue to evaluate them.”Noting that Moderna took 42 days to produce the original vaccine, he said the company could make a new one “hopefully a little faster this time, but not much.”One reason the current vaccine remains effective is a “cushion effect,” meaning it provokes such a powerful immune response that it will remain highly protective even with some drop in antibody strength, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s leading expert on infectious diseases, and President Biden’s adviser on the coronavirus, said at a news briefing on Friday.Experts also cautioned against assuming that a decrease in neutralizing ability meant the vaccines were powerless against the new variants. Neutralizing antibodies are just one component of the body’s immune defense, noted Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.“In real life, there’s also T cells and memory B cells and non-neutralizing antibodies and all these other effectors that are going to be induced by the vaccine,” Dr. Iwasaki said. Neutralizing power is “very important, but it’s not the only thing that’s going to protect someone.”So long as the authorized vaccines continue to work against the variants, the challenge will be to inoculate as many people as possible and to prevent the coronavirus from evolving into more impervious forms. “That for me is still the highest priority,” said Dr. Sahin, of BioNTech.Then, he said, perhaps six to nine months later, people could be given a boost that was customized for the variant.The pace of the vaccine rollout in the United States, at least, may be picking up. Dr. Fauci predicted on Sunday that two million inoculations daily might soon be possible.But there are many countries where no one has been immunized. With richer countries buying up doses early, some populations may have to wait till 2022 at the earliest to gain access to any vaccines.In theory, new variants emerging in other parts of the world could render the virus resistant to the vaccines, Dr. Nussenzweig said, and they would inevitably spread. It is therefore in everyone’s interest to immunize the world as quickly as possible, he added: “We can’t hermetically seal ourselves from the rest of the world.”Hoping to contain the new variants, the administration has upheld bans on travel by noncitizens into the United States from Europe and Brazil. President Biden will ban travel by noncitizens from South Africa starting Saturday. But that variant may already be in the United States, researchers said.The mRNA technology used in both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines allows them to be created and reformulated much faster than vaccines made with more traditional methods.“This is the beauty of the mRNA vaccines — they’re very versatile,” Dr. Iwasaki said. But a new formulation may not even be necessary, she added. A third dose of the current vaccine may be enough to boost levels of antibodies.Dr. Zaks said that discussions with regulators about what would be required to bring a new version of the vaccine to the public were just starting.“It’s early days,” he said.</body>

	<title>Biden busca la unidad, pero los republicanos no piensan lo mismo</title>
	<author>Peter Baker</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Cuando declaró que su misión histórica era unir a un país dividido, el presidente Joe Biden hizo de la “unidad” la consigna de su mandato recién iniciado. Pero uno de los factores que divide a Estados Unidos es el significado verdadero de la palabra unidad.En su discurso inaugural del miércoles y en otras alocuciones públicas, Biden se dirigió a los republicanos con mensajes de conciliación, y prometió que trabajarían juntos para enfrentar los enormes desafíos que aquejan a la nación: un tono extremadamente distinto al que solía adoptar el expresidente Donald Trump. Sin embargo, en las primeras horas del gobierno de Biden, la reconciliación se basó más en palabras y símbolos que en acciones tangibles.No designó a ningún miembro de la oposición como parte de su gabinete, a diferencia de los presidentes Bill Clinton, George W. Bush y Barack Obama, y muchas de las órdenes ejecutivas que firmó en sus primeros dos días en el cargo tuvieron como objetivo revertir las políticas de Trump y promulgar ideas liberales, no encontrar puntos en común. No ha dado ningún ejemplo de las prioridades republicanas que estaría dispuesto a adoptar en aras de una cooperación bipartidista ni ha descrito cuáles concesiones serían aceptables a cambio de que el Congreso apruebe sus iniciativas.No obstante, Biden y sus aliados argumentan que la unidad no es lo mismo que la concesión, es más un cambio en la cultura, no se trata de hacer una repartición de las opiniones diversas en los planes de políticas. Tras una presidencia que echó sal a las heridas de la raza, la religión, el género, la orientación sexual y la cultura, y que luego buscó anular una elección democrática que incitó a una turba a asaltar el Capitolio, la unidad puede significar un compromiso renovado con los valores más universales de Estados Unidos. Este argumento plantea que ambos bandos aún librarán batallas enérgicas para defender sus ideas, pero deben ser debates de buena voluntad en vez de operaciones de búsqueda y destrucción.“A fin de cuentas, una mayor unidad requerirá un consenso más amplio sobre la valía del gobierno mismo, que es precisamente la razón por la que Biden está enfatizando las acciones competentes del gobierno como la clave para la recuperación de la pandemia y la crisis económica”, dijo Paul Bledsoe, exmiembro del Senado y del personal de la Casa Blanca de Clinton que ahora trabaja en el Progressive Policy Institute.Desde siempre, Biden ha sido un apóstol del bipartidismo y cultivó buenas amistades con figuras de ambos partidos en el transcurso de 36 años en el Senado y 8 años como vicepresidente. Sin embargo, las estructuras de incentivación han cambiado. Antes los políticos percibían una recompensa política por al menos aparentar una postura bipartidista, pero ahora perciben el riesgo de ser acusados de traicionar sus principios por los elementos más apasionados de su propio partido. Muchos ven la concesión como un vicio, no una virtud.Los destellos de cortesía entre partidos que se vieron en la ceremonia de investidura ya estaban desapareciendo al día siguiente. El jueves, los demócratas y los republicanos del Senado discutieron para definir las reglas que regirán a su cámara dividida en partes iguales durante los próximos dos años, así como el proceso que se seguirá con el juicio político de Trump, quien será enjuiciado por incitar una insurrección. Los republicanos se quejaron de que la agenda del nuevo presidente en materia de inmigración, economía y medioambiente se aprobó mediante órdenes ejecutivas y que sus proyectos de ley no los contemplaban en absoluto.“Biden tenía un buen mensaje de unidad”, escribió en Twitter Alyssa Farah, quien fue la última directora de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca antes de renunciar después del asalto al Capitolio, “pero las políticas hasta ahora solo están dirigidas a la mitad del país, a los que lo apoyaron, y no hay señales de querer conectar con quienes no lo hicieron”.Al mismo tiempo, Biden también estará bajo presión desde el otro lado del espectro político. Los liberales de su propio partido se resistirán a cualquier medida que parezca socavar las prescripciones políticas que favorecen por lo que consideran como una noción equivocada de cooperación con los republicanos.“Para mí, Biden puede ser más unificador si continúa impulsando estas políticas populistas audaces que ponen dinero en los bolsillos de las personas, que las hacen sentir que vuelven a tener oportunidades y que este virus tiene una solución”, dijo en una entrevista Pramila Jayapal, representante demócrata por el estado de Washington y presidenta del Caucus Progresista del Congreso. “Se tiene que enfocar en eso. No podemos permitir que la búsqueda de un compromiso, por cuestión de principios, elimine la necesidad de ofrecer resultados para la gente”.El juicio político pendiente contra Trump se ha convertido en un punto de fricción en los primeros días de la presidencia de Biden, pues el segmento del Partido Republicano que aún apoya al exmandatario lo retrata como un acto de venganza que contradice las promesas de unidad.“Debo decir que es difícil unificar a la gente cuando se someterá a juicio político a un presidente que ya no está en funciones”, dijo en una entrevista Jim Jordan, representante por Ohio y uno de los defensores acérrimos de Trump. “Es difícil unificar a la gente cuando no podemos plantear nuestros argumentos debido a la cultura de la cancelación”.Los defensores de Trump dijeron que Biden debía convocar a los demócratas del Congreso y decirles que los dejen en paz. “El hecho de que se niegue a hacer eso me demuestra que en realidad no tiene la habilidad ni la disposición de unificarnos porque eso lo dejaría fuera del juego”, declaró para Fox News el senador republicano por Carolina del Sur, Lindsey Graham.Los demócratas se mofaron de esa sugerencia, pues sostienen que la unidad no equivale a sacrificar la rendición de cuentas. Un grupo de senadores demócratas presentó una queja el jueves ante el Comité Selecto de Ética del Senado en contra de dos republicanos aliados de Trump, los senadores Ted Cruz, por Texas, y Josh Hawley, por Misuri, en la que los acusaba de validar a la turba al oponerse al voto del Colegio Electoral a favor de Biden.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.“No creo que sea muy unificador decir: ‘Olvidémoslo todo y pasemos a otra cosa’. Así no se unifica a la gente”, les dijo a los reporteros Nancy Pelosi, la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes. “No se supone que se le diga a un presidente: ‘Haz lo que quieras en los últimos meses de tu mandato. Te van a dar una tarjeta que te liberará de la cárcel porque la gente piensa que deberíamos ser amables y olvidar que hubo muertes el 6 de enero’”.Biden ha tratado de eludir el problema del juicio político y el jueves se enfocó en anunciar medidas para contrarrestar la pandemia de coronavirus que ya ha costado más de 400.000 vidas en Estados Unidos, y las presentó como un objetivo compartido. “Podemos hacer esto si nos unimos”, dijo. “Es por eso que, en última instancia, nuestro plan se basa en la unidad y todos actuamos como una sola nación”.La nueva secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Jen Psaki, descartó la noción de que la apertura de Biden con sus adversarios no cumpla su promesa de unidad, argumentando que el seguro de desempleo, la reapertura de escuelas y la aceleración de la distribución de vacunas no son cuestiones partidistas. Añadió que el compromiso de Biden es escuchar a los republicanos y tratarlos con seriedad, pero no necesariamente estar de acuerdo con ellos en todos los puntos.“Dirán que no están buscando algo simbólico”, dijo Psaki. “Ellos buscan un compromiso, buscan tener una conversación, entablar un diálogo y eso es exactamente lo que él va a hacer”.Los republicanos se quejaron de que no hubo ningún debate antes de que Biden anunciara su proyecto de ley de inmigración que abriría el camino a la ciudadanía para 11 millones de personas que viven en Estados Unidos de manera ilegal y, al mismo tiempo, frenará muchas deportaciones y suspenderá la construcción del muro fronterizo de Trump. La civilidad, afirmaron, no es lo mismo que la unidad.“El bipartidismo no se basa en el tono, sino en la política”, comentó Josh Holmes, estratega republicano y exjefe de personal del senador por Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, el líder de la minoría republicana. “Creo que él ya dominó el tono, pero eso no es unidad. Si tomas medidas radicales y partidistas con amabilidad, no estás fomentando la unidad”.Los demócratas se burlaron de las quejas de los republicanos por lo que definen como el extenso historial de obstruccionismo de McConnell, y sostuvieron que también los republicanos tenían la responsabilidad de cumplir con Biden. Además, dijeron, la unidad no requiere la rendición unilateral de las promesas que el mandatario hizo durante la campaña.“Si trabajan con él, él trabajará con ellos”, dijo John D. Podesta, exjefe de gabinete de la Casa Blanca bajo la dirección de Clinton y consejero de Obama. “Pero eso no significa desechar su programa principal. Si el presidente les dice: ‘Creo que fuiste demasiado lejos al reducirles los impuestos a los ricos’, y ellos contestan: ‘Bueno, eso significa que no te tomas en serio la unidad’, eso es un mal chiste”.Peter Baker es el corresponsal principal de la Casa Blanca y ha cubierto las gestiones de los últimos cuatro presidentes para el Times y The Washington Post. También es autor de seis libros, el más reciente de ellos se titula The Man Who Ran Washington: The Life and Times of James A. Baker III. @peterbakernyt • Facebook</body>

	<title>How the 3 Diallo Sisters Were Finally Able to Connect to Their Classes</title>
	<author>Andy Newman</author>
	<body>School days at the Diallo sisters’ apartment in the Bronx can be hectic.Adama, the oldest, attends high school from the black couch in the corner of their apartment in a family homeless shelter. Her 10-year-old sister, Hawaou, sits nearby at the dining table, firing back answers to her math teacher’s questions. Her youngest sister, Aissatou, 7, sprawled on a bed in the other room, giggles her way through her second-grade lessons.“It’s a lot of noises,” said Adama, 14.Still, the family’s remote-learning setup works. The operator of their shelter got the place wired for Wi-Fi in the spring, shortly after the pandemic shut down schools, so that students from the building’s 79 families could attend school online.At Aaron Morris’s apartment at a shelter in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, it’s a different story. Aaron, 15, is still getting kicked offline many times a day, and it has affected his grades — and his moods.“It upsets me to the point I just want to quit and not go to school at all,” he said earlier this month.Providing reliable internet access to the city’s 111,000 children in homeless shelters and unstable housing has been one of the most stubborn obstacles to getting online schooling right, and for many students there’s no relief in sight. The city belatedly started putting Wi-Fi in 200 family shelters in November and says it won’t finish until the end of summer, after a second pandemic school year has come and gone.In November, when a lawsuit demanded that the city speed up and complete the Wi-Fi project by early January, the city protested that it was being asked to “perform the impossible,” listing 14 bureaucratic hurdles to be cleared at each shelter before installation could even begin.But operators who collectively run more than a dozen of the city’s 200 family shelters have proved it is not impossible at all.Recognizing the urgency of the situation — no connection means no school — they took it upon themselves to get their buildings wired months ago and got it done within weeks — most for a fraction of what the city is paying the cable giants Spectrum and Optimum to do the job over nearly a year.The city is installing cable and a Wi-Fi router in every shelter apartment, while most shelters that did it themselves had contractors install access points in hallways that they say provide fine service.“Given the fiscal crisis the city finds itself in, this is just silly,” Catherine Trapani, executive director of Homeless Services United, a coalition of shelter operators, said in mid-January. “There’s a cheaper, faster way — what is the reason you wouldn’t try to do it?”Robin Levine, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, said in a statement that installing a Wi-Fi setup in each apartment was “the only way to ensure families will have a permanent, reliable way to access the internet.”The city’s solution “accounts for long-term support needs” and is overall “better, stronger and cheaper,” Ms. Levine wrote.The city declined to say how many students in homeless shelters still lack reliable internet but has said in court filings that a survey starting in late October found nearly 3,000 shelter families with school-age children reported problems with city-issued iPads.As frustrating and cumbersome as remote schooling has been for students and families all over, the process of getting New York’s poorest students connected has been a case study in complication. When Mayor Bill de Blasio shut down schools on March 15, his Department of Education began distributing internet-equipped iPads with unlimited T-Mobile data plans to every child who needed one. But inside many shelters, T-Mobile’s signal was weak or nonexistent.At Bronxworks, which operates three shelters — including the one on Nelson Avenue where the Diallo sisters live with their mother, Fatoumata Kamano, a home health aide — officials saw disaster unfolding. Even before the coronavirus, the constant disruptions of homelessness meant that more than half of the students at the Bronxworks shelters were chronically absent from school.“We immediately realized that we needed to get Wi-Fi in our buildings,” said Scott Auwarter, the assistant executive director of Bronxworks.Bronxworks contacted a cable company but determined it would take too long and charge too much. So Bronxworks had its security-camera contractor piggyback Wi-Fi for residents onto the existing network. By mid-May, the vendor had installed one hallway hot spot for every three apartments. It cost about $300, plus about $2 per month for service, per apartment.“Our approach was more of the Starbucks coffee approach,” Mr. Auwarter said: “It’s just cheaper, easier, faster, nobody can tamper with it, and it’s been maintenance-free.”The city’s effort, meanwhile, was floundering. The school year ended with many homeless students having missed most or all of the final three months.Over the summer, another shelter provider, HELP USA, which houses over 600 families in seven shelters in the city, raced to get its buildings wired. “We had one site that took like two months to install — there was a lot of conduit that had to be laid and holes drilled in walls,” said Stephen Mott, HELP USA’s chief of staff.Still, he said, the project was completed in August, for about $400 per apartment, plus about $3 per month for service. Ms. Trapani of Homeless Services United said she knew of two other operators who wired their buildings.After the new school year began in September, the city switched more than a thousand students’ iPads from T-Mobile to Verizon, but many still had problems.In October, after the Legal Aid Society threatened a class-action suit on behalf of Aaron Morris and others, accusing the city of denying homeless students their right to basic education, Mr. de Blasio said the city would install Wi-Fi in every shelter.It has budgeted around $13 million to pay Charter and Altice, the parent companies of Spectrum and Optimum, to wire 10,500 shelter apartments — more than $1,200 per unit — plus $20 per month for service.That is more than triple what Bronxworks and HELP USA are paying.One of the first shelters the city connected was Aaron’s, the Albemarle Family Residence.But Aaron said the Wi-Fi unit “hasn’t helped at all.” He has simply traded his cell-signal problems for Wi-Fi problems. Most days, he said, he gets disconnected from his classes at the High School for Youth and Community Development multiple times. “Even if I know the answer to a question, I can’t share it,” he said. He said the glitches cause him to submit homework late. “My grade can be a 90 and it drops down to a 75,” he said.In a motion opposing the class action, the city said it had already hired 50 technicians to troubleshoot I.T. problems for shelter families, opened a dedicated help desk for shelter students and surveyed each family’s connectivity needs. It noted that many shelters lacked the infrastructure needed to run cable throughout the building and will require custom construction. It said the project would take two years if not for the city’s “aggressive efforts” to finish by September.Last month, the federal judge in the case rejected the city’s arguments that it was doing enough to provide homeless students access to education and ruled that the suit could proceed to trial. On Sunday, the city moved to dismiss the suit.A spokesman for Charter said on Thursday that the company was nearly half done with its installations and expected to finish “well before summer.” A spokeswoman for Altice referred questions on when it expected to complete its work back to the city.Susan Horwitz, head of the Legal Aid Society’s Education Law Project, said there were many ways the city could speed up the project, including learning from shelter operators like HELP USA that installed Wi-Fi in buildings that lacked infrastructure, hiring more installers and scaling back from wiring each apartment.“It’s such obvious stuff,” she said. “I just keep shaking my head and saying, ‘Really, that’s what they’re doing?’”</body>

	<title>Some homeless shelter operators in N.Y.C. bypass the city to speed up Wi-Fi access.</title>

	<title>‘Framing Britney Spears’</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>Producer/Director Samantha StarkSenior Editor Liz DayNow streaming on Hulu and available here for New York Times subscribers in the U.S.“I just want my life back.” Britney Spears told a Los Angeles judge in June during a rare court appearance. The pop star said she had been drugged, compelled to work against her will and prevented from removing her birth control device under a legal arrangement that had ruled her life for more than 13 years. “I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive,” Spears told the court. “I don’t feel like I can live a full life.” Indeed the life and career of one of music’s biggest superstars, who enthralled audiences in the 1990s as she ascended to global stardom, has been at a standstill since 2008. That’s when, at age 26, Spears had her rights curtailed under a court-sanctioned conservatorship that put decisions about her fortune — and even her body — in the hands of others, including her father. Now 39, Spears has publicly demanded to be freed from the conservatorship and an end to her father’s legal control of her, something she had been quietly pushing for years to change. Our Emmy-nominated documentary captures what the public might not know about the nature of Spears’s conservatorship and her court battle with her father over who should control her estate.The documentary, “Framing Britney Spears,” features interviews with key insiders, including:a lifelong family friend who traveled alongside Spears for much of her careerthe marketing executive who originally created Spears’s imagea lawyer working on the conservatorship for Spears’s fatherand the lawyer Spears tried to hire in the early days of the conservatorship to challenge her fatherThe New York Times documentary, streaming on FX and Hulu, also explores the fervent fan base that has been agitating to “Free Britney,” and re-examines the media’s handling of one of the biggest pop stars of all time.Producer Liz HodesDirector of Photography Emily TopperVideo Editors Geoff O’Brien and Pierre TakalAssociate Producer Melanie Bencosme“The New York Times Presents” is a series of documentaries representing the unparalleled journalism and insight of The New York Times, bringing viewers close to the essential stories of our time.</body>

	<title>Rich nations will pay a price if poor nations are shut out of vaccines.</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>Wealthy nations have been hoarding the scant supplies of coronavirus vaccines in an effort to save lives and revive their devastated economies.But to inoculate wealthy states while shutting out poor nations would be extremely costly, according to an academic study set to be published on Monday, Peter S. Goodman writes in The New York Times. In the most dire scenario, the global economy would lose more than $9 trillion — that’s more than the yearly output of Germany and Japan combined.So far, a staggered rollout of the vaccine is playing out where so-called developed countries appear to be first in line. As they rush to fully vaccinate their citizens by the middle of this year, developing countries would be able to inject only half of their populations by the end of the year.Even in that case, the world economy would suffer by as much as $3.8 trillion, and it is the wealthy nations such as the United States that would absorb the brunt of that loss.The study was commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce, and it proffered a different solution. The equal distribution of vaccines to all countries would be in every country’s economic interests.In a business universe that has become so globally interconnected that few, if any, industries operate in isolation, a staggered rollout of vaccines would cripple businesses worldwide. Companies large and small rely on supplies and customers from almost every continent, and to inoculate one group ahead of another would do nothing to free up the global flow of commerce.At least one philanthropic group, the ACT Accelerator, is working to close the gap by trying to raise $38 billion to help developing nations get vaccines faster. So far, it has secured a commitment for only about $11 billion.</body>

	<title>Rash of Coronavirus Cases Poses Early Challenge for the Australian Open</title>
	<author>Matthew Futterman</author>
	<body>MELBOURNE, Australia — It was late December, and Craig Tiley was feeling good. After months of negotiations with government officials and the world’s top tennis players, Tiley, the head of Tennis Australia, finally had the green light to stage the Australian Open in the middle of the pandemic.Health officials and government leaders had come around to the idea of more than a thousand people arriving from overseas, including hundreds of players who would enjoy privileges during their 14-day quarantine period that Australian citizens could not. And the players had agreed to spend virtually their entire day in their hotel rooms for two weeks and to limit their on-court practice time to just two hours each day.“The players are being great,” Tiley said then of the deal for a limited quarantine period. “They realized if they didn’t want to do it, there would be no Australian Open, no lead-in events and no chance at $83 million in prize money.”A month later, Tiley, a native of South Africa and a former college coach in the United States, is at the center of mounting anger from every side after six people on three chartered flights tested positive for the coronavirus upon their arrival in Melbourne.The positive tests have rankled citizens, some of whom complained that Tennis Australia was putting residents at risk to placate millionaire tennis players. The chief health officer for the state of Victoria took action, ordering everyone on the chartered planes, including 72 players who were supposed to be able to practice and spend time in the gym at the tennis center, to stay in their hotel rooms for 14 days, even though none of the players at the time had tested positive.Then came a report that the top-ranked men’s player, Novak Djokovic, the leader of a nascent players’ association, issued a series of demands, including reducing the isolation period for players who continued to test negative and moving as many players as possible to private homes with a tennis court to facilitate training. Health officials quickly rejected them.“We’ve been knocked around because of the flights and the challenges,” Tiley said Monday afternoon during a teleconference with some of the people in quarantine. “I have not had any place I can hide.”In a matter of days, Tiley has gone from one of the most visible cheerleaders for Australian sports to its leading punching bag, while his organization’s signature tournament has transformed from a potential celebration in the rare corner of the world where the virus has been kept under control to yet another symbol of virus uncertainty.In the past 48 hours, government officials, including members of parliament and the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, went on television and attacked the decision to prioritize tennis over what they believed were more essential needs, such as bringing in seasonal workers, easing state border restrictions or allowing some 40,000 Australians to return from overseas. They cannot, in part, because of strict limits on daily international arrivals.The limits remain even though Australia long ago ended one of the world’s strictest virus-related lockdowns. In Melbourne, the police enforced a nearly four-month assault on the virus. During that time, schools and businesses were closed and residents were allowed outside for just one hour (and later two) each day, either to exercise or to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy. They also had to remain within three miles of home unless they had a permit.The strict approach has worked. Australia has one of the lowest per capita rates of infection among large countries.When the lockdown was lifted, Tiley spent months battling to gain special privileges for tennis players he said were essential to salvage the tournament. He pushed to hold the championship as close as possible to its traditional mid-January start, rather than moving it to another country or delaying it until December, when vaccines should be more widely available.He pledged to spend millions to charter planes and cover the costs of a limited quarantine of arriving players, plus a full quarantine for most of the rest of the more than 1,200 people coming for the Australian Open, which is set to begin Feb. 8, and three tuneup events.In an interview in late December, Tiley said there was no guarantee that life would be any more normal by December 2021. “Is it risky now? Yes, but it could be just as risky in December,” he said.The immediate risks became evident shortly after players began arriving late last week. First, there was word on Saturday that a flight attendant and another passenger had tested positive on a flight from Los Angeles (a third person later tested positive). Then Tiley announced that a passenger on a plane from Abu Dhabi — Sylvain Bruneau, the coach of Bianca Andreescu, a 2019 United States Open champion, acknowledged he was the one — had tested positive. On Sunday, it was someone, again not a player, on the plane from Doha, and another from the Abu Dhabi flight.More than 70 players who opted to come to Australia assuming they would be able to train as long as they tested negative were ordered to remain inside their hotel rooms for two weeks. Many took to social media to complain. Some asked to leave the country immediately and were told they could not. Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, rejected such moves. “People are free to provide lists of demands, but the answer is no,” Andrews told reporters. “There’s no special treatment here.”Tiley denied complaints from players that Tennis Australia had not warned them of the potential for a strict quarantine without access to tennis courts.He said there were weekly phone calls for four months with members of the player councils for the men’s and women’s professional tours during which he made it clear that Australia had a mandatory 14-day quarantine requirement for anyone who had close contact with someone who had tested positive.“I reminded them that was always going to be a risk,” Tiley said during a Monday teleconference. “Even now,” he said, “if there is a major outbreak, the health commissioner for Victoria could next week rule that no players can practice during quarantine.”Monday brought further complications as officials unexpectedly canceled all training at Melbourne Park until 3:30 p.m. because they could not safely coordinate the arrival of so many people until later in the day.Three additional positive tests were returned on Monday, two of them involving players, but Tiley said on Tuesday evening that the cases appeared to be what is known as viral shedding, rather than acute positives, and he did not expect changes to the number of people on hard lockdowns.Daria Abramowicz, the sports psychologist for the 2020 French Open women’s singles champion, Iga Swiatek, who missed her Monday practice session, said on Monday that all the uncertainty was testing the nerves of players.“Information gives a sense of security and stability,” she said. “Everyone needs the tools of adjustment right now.”Tiley pledged to do whatever he could to make players more comfortable, with additional food and exercise equipment. He said officials were examining the competition schedule set to start on Jan. 31 to find any adjustments that could be made to help players unable to practice for two weeks, other than hitting balls against the walls of their hotel rooms.“It’s not a great situation,” he said. “You’re stuck in your room for a 14-day period.”</body>

	<title>How West Virginia Became a U.S. Leader in Vaccine Rollout</title>
	<author>Sarah Mervosh</author>
	<body>CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Carolyn Zain had heard horror stories about the nation’s coronavirus vaccine rollout: long waits, clunky websites, people being turned away. So when her health department announced it was expanding appointments, she armed herself with two phones — cellphone in one hand, landline in the other — and held her breath.Within 20 minutes, she secured a slot for the next day. She arrived for her 2 p.m. appointment and was resting in a chair, a fresh shot in her arm, by 2:21 p.m.“It went wonderfully,” said Ms. Zain, 79, who, after a year spent mostly home alone, wore a sequined face mask that shimmered like confetti for her appointment at a Charleston clinic last week.Since the nation began distributing vaccines more than a month ago, it has moved far more slowly than officials hoped and has been stymied by widespread logistical problems. But West Virginia has stood out for its success in getting people vaccinated. About 9 percent of all West Virginians have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, a larger segment than in every state but Alaska and double the rate of some. No state has given a larger share of its residents second doses, a crucial step to securing the best chance at immunity.While many states are struggling to hand out the shots that the federal government has provided to them, West Virginia has given out 83 percent of its doses, by far among the highest. The patchwork system of distribution in the country is in its early weeks, and experts say operations may change significantly as vaccinations gear up further, but many states so far have struggled to give even half of their allotted vaccines. California and Rhode Island have used just 45 percent of their shots.“West Virginia is about at the top of the charts,” said Dr. Mark McClellan, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We need to get more states to the point that they have the vaccination capacity of West Virginia.”As many states struggle with logistical and bureaucratic challenges, leaving vaccines unused, West Virginia offers a remarkable example of a state that has successfully given out almost all of its shots. Yet it provides perhaps the clearest picture of a more fundamental problem that looms ahead for the country: Even the most efficient state vaccine operations do not have enough shots for all who want them.“It’s not like it’s a cake walk, but we have efficiency,” said Dr. Clay Marsh, the state coronavirus czar. He estimated that West Virginia has the capacity to handle 125,000 doses a week, but is getting just 23,600. At the current pace, officials said, it could take up to five months to finish vaccinating people 65 and older, let alone younger people in the general population.“We can push a lot more,” Dr. Marsh said. “We just don’t have anything to push.”The race to vaccinate millions of Americans comes as the country confronts worrying new variants of the virus. The stakes are particularly high in West Virginia, where residents are among the oldest and least healthy in the nation. Two in 10 West Virginians are 65 or older, and nearly half of adults have a higher risk of developing a serious case of Covid-19.“People are dying every day,” said Albert L. Wright Jr., the chief executive of WVU Medicine, the state’s largest health care provider, which opened a mega-clinic in Morgantown last week. “We just realized, the only way out of this is to vaccinate our way out.”While the rollout in West Virginia has not been without its frustrations for the many residents who are desperate to receive the vaccine, the state’s approach offers insight into what has worked.Early on, the state got a significant head start because it initially opted out of a federal program to vaccinate people in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.While other states chose the federal plan, which partnered with Walgreens and CVS to inoculate people in nursing homes around the country, officials decided the idea made little sense in West Virginia, where many communities are tucked into the hills, miles from the nearest big box store, and about half of pharmacies are independently owned.West Virginia created a network of pharmacies in the state, pairing them with about 200 long-term care facilities. As a result, West Virginia finished its first round of vaccinations at nursing homes last month, while many states were just getting started. By the end of this week, officials expect to have delivered a second round of shots to all nursing homes.A growing number of governors and state health officials have voiced frustration with the speed of the federal program, which has been slow in part because of the sheer number of long-term care facilities nationwide. Some states, like Maine, have also begun looking to local pharmacies as a resource.“Using your local partners and really having more control over where the vaccine is going, that’s what has been successful for West Virginia,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.The approach in some ways reflects the scrappy outlook that has become embedded in West Virginia, a state that is used to being labeled in broad strokes by outsiders. After years of coming in at the bottom of various national rankings — highest rate of cigarette smokers, largest share of adults with multiple chronic conditions, among the highest prevalence of diabetes and obesity — there is a sense of proud defiance around the state’s vaccine plan.“Our state motto is montani semper liberi — mountaineers are always free,” said Stephen New, a lawyer in Beckley, whose father, a former coal miner, is scheduled to get vaccinated at a local clinic this week. “There is a fierce sense of independence here that we don’t need to follow others.”Central to West Virginia’s strategy, too, is putting the National Guard at the helm of vaccine operations.“They are logistical experts,” said Jim Kranz, a vice president at the West Virginia Hospital Association, who described a military approach far different than typical government bureaucracies jammed up by memos and lengthy meetings. “The Guard just says, ‘I don’t need a written plan, this is what we’re doing.’”In recent weeks, other states have increasingly been turning to the National Guard for assistance.Inside a former drill hall on the National Guard’s gated campus in Charleston, a core state team of representatives from various agencies meets at a command center, working amid a labyrinth of computer screens, white boards and plexiglass dividers, in the shadow of an enormous American flag.Officials in West Virginia say the in-person command center, which runs counter to pandemic-era Zoom meetings and may come with health risks, has also helped quickly resolve problems. For instance, a recent brainstorming meeting led to a swift change: To avoid a mix-up between Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, officials changed the colors of cards showing that a resident had been vaccinated — red for Moderna, blue for Pfizer.“It’s a person at a table,” said Joe Peal, a retired colonel and the chief of staff for the vaccine task force. “We absolutely could not do it virtually.”Officials say they have also learned what not to do — including not promising shots that they don’t yet have.After a crowd of people in their 80s unexpectedly showed up outside the health department in Charleston one shivering winter night, officials there decided clinics could not be first-come, first-served. They required appointments, and to avoid later rescinding those appointments, as has happened in states like New York and Florida, appointments are not made until the county officials have that week’s allotment of vaccines on hand, sitting in their own freezer.Some of West Virginia’s success also may partly be explained by characteristics of the state. Its population, 1.8 million people, is tiny compared to states like Texas, which are handling far more vaccines. West Virginia is also among only a handful of states that do not allow philosophical exemptions for vaccines for school, according to the Immunization Action Coalition, suggesting a culture where acceptance of vaccines may be more prevalent. West Virginia’s rollout has by no means been without hiccups. And some of the problems have been similar to those in states with far worse records in distributing shots: Phone lines have been mobbed and many West Virginians have spent hours calling to get appointments without success.The health department in Kanawha County, which includes Charleston, was so overloaded with phone calls last week, its phone system crashed and its Facebook page was flooded with complaints. “I’ve called 250+ times but still unable to get through,” one person wrote.The distribution of vaccines — mainly to health care workers and older residents so far — also has been concentrated in urban centers, raising concerns about equal access in rural and more impoverished areas. Of the state’s 10 poorest counties, just one had a vaccine clinic in recent weeks, according to an analysis by the nonprofit newsroom Mountain State Spotlight. But the main problem, officials say, is not logistical but a matter of supply: They need more vaccine.Dr. Sherri Young, the health officer in Kanawha County, said one big reason phone lines are overrun is because the county cannot reliably schedule clinics weeks in advance. If there were more vaccine, she said, “people wouldn’t be as panicked.”Pfizer and Moderna have pledged to deliver a combined 200 million doses for use in the United States by the end of March, with an additional 200 million doses to be delivered by the end of July. A third vaccine maker, Johnson &amp; Johnson, could put millions more doses on the market if approved.West Virginia had hoped to make the case that because it is moving through its vaccines, it deserved to get more, but so far states have been allocated doses based on population.Jim Doria, 69, a retired epidemiologist, had gone months without seeing his grandchildren who live in Philadelphia and was eager to be among the first to get vaccinated after the state opened the system to people in his age group last week. He estimated that he called as many as 700 times.“I won the lottery,” he said, after getting off a wait list.But for every person like Mr. Doria, countless others were left disappointed. Statewide, West Virginia has given shots to around 70,000 of its senior citizens, with more than 250,000 left to go.</body>

	<title>Justice Dept. charges militia members, including military veterans, in Capitol assault.</title>
	<author>Adam Goldman</author>
	<body>The Justice Department has charged suspected members of the Three Percenters, a militia group that emerged some years ago from the extremist wing of the gun-rights movement, and of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group founded by law enforcement and military veterans, as it works to determine whether the extremist groups conspired to attack Congress.The charges include unlawful entry, assault on a federal officer, disorderly conduct, destruction of federal property, obstruction of an official proceeding and obstruction of justice.On Sunday evening, Donovan Crowl, 50, a former U.S. Marine, and Jessica Watkins, 38, an Army veteran, turned themselves in to authorities in Ohio after they published photos of themselves on social media wearing combat gear and saying that they had stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in order to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College victory of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.The F.B.I. said that Ms. Watkins’s group is a unit of the Oath Keepers and that she and Mr. Crowl were wearing Oath Keepers patches.The recent arrests of veterans and former law enforcement personnel underscore the Justice Department’s worry that some of the attackers may have been part of more coordinated efforts to attack Congress and that they employed specialized skills in the assault. Videos and photos have revealed chilling scenes of rioters weaving through the mobs inside the Capitol in tight formation, wearing tactical gear, carrying restraints, and using hand signals to communicate.Michael R. Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, said on Friday that his prosecutors were working to build more serious sedition and murder cases against such groups if the evidence permits, and that focusing on militia members and other extremists would be a top priority.“All of these extremist groups are being looked at in terms of their participation at the Capitol,” Mr. Sherwin said.Federal prosecutors also unsealed charges this weekend against Robert Gieswein, 24, of Woodland Park, Colo., who they say is affiliated with the Three Percenters. The group’s name is a reference to the purported 3 percent of the U.S. colonial population who rose up to fight against the British Army.Mr. Gieswein, who runs a private paramilitary training group called the Woodland Wild Dogs, was among the early wave of invaders to breach the building, court papers say. Photographs from the attack show him clad in a military vest, goggles and an Army-style helmet, wrestling with Capitol Police officers to remove metal barricades and brandishing a baseball bat. In a criminal complaint, prosecutors cite a video that shows Mr. Gieswein encouraging other rioters as they smash a window at the Capitol with a wooden board and a plastic shield, and then climbing through the broken glass into the building.The F.B.I. also arrested Guy Wesley Reffitt of Texas and charged him on Saturday with obstruction. The F.B.I. said he belonged to the Texas Freedom Force, a militia extremist group, while Mr. Reffitt’s wife said he was a member of the Three Percenters.The deadly assault on the Capitol is expected to be a “significant driver of violence” for armed militia groups and racist extremists in the days ahead, federal authorities have said in recently issued intelligence bulletins.</body>

	<title>The case for and against sending Americans bigger stimulus checks.</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>Are $2,000 stimulus checks a good way to help the economy and fight poverty or a misuse of government resources?The centerpiece of President Biden’s coronavirus economic relief plan — to send Americans another $1,400 in addition to the $600 already authorized by Congress — polls well with the public, but some economists and politicians from both parties have reservations.In The Morning newsletter, David Leonhardt lays out three main arguments both for and against the idea, based on his conversations with experts:1. People need help. Almost 10 million fewer Americans are working now than when the pandemic began, and normal life is still months from returning. The checks will let people decide for themselves how to spend the money, and much of this spending will stimulate the economy and create jobs.2. It’s simple. At a time when many people don’t trust the government, easy-to-understand policies can build trust. The Obama administration designed a complex stimulus program in 2009 and didn’t get much political credit for it.3. It’s surprisingly progressive. The check means much more to a poor or working-class family than it does to an upper-middle-class family. (Very affluent families don’t qualify for the checks.)1. Many people don’t need the money. Neither house prices nor stock prices have fallen — and many people’s expenses have declined — leaving most Americans financially better off than a year ago. As a result, many people will save the money the government sends them.2. It’s possible to target the money. Mr. Biden’s stimulus could instead increase unemployment benefits even more than it now proposes. Or it could do more to help small businesses stay open. Or more to expand child care.3. F.D.R. wouldn’t have done it. Sending people money does little to address the country’s deepest problems — like climate change and the underlying causes of inequality. Those problems require coordinated government action.“I don’t ever remember F.D.R. recommending sending a damn penny to a human being. He gave ’em a job and gave ’em a paycheck,” Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, has said.</body>

	<title>The I.R.S. will start accepting tax returns on Feb. 12, about two weeks later than usual.</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>Late-year tax changes approved by Congress are now forcing the I.R.S. to push back the start of tax filing season, reports The New York Times’s Ann Carrns.Even so, the I.R.S. said, most taxpayers due a refund for the 2020 tax year will get it within three weeks if they file electronically and have the money deposited directly into their bank account. The average refund in recent years has been more than $2,500. Many families use refunds to pay bills or use it as a kind of forced savings plan.Typically, the Internal Revenue Service begins accepting and processing individual income tax returns in late January. But the agency has pushed back the start of filing to Feb. 12 for returns for the tax year 2020.The I.R.S. Free File program is ready to use now, if you are comfortable preparing your own tax return. Free File, a partnership between the I.R.S. and tax software companies, is available to people with adjusted gross income of $72,000 or less. The program offers free online preparation and filing of federal returns, but some providers charge fees for state returns. You can complete your return now, and it will be transmitted to the I.R.S. starting Feb. 12.This is shaping up to be another challenging tax season for the Internal Revenue Service, which has struggled in recent years with reduced budgets that have forced it to make do with fewer workers and outdated computer systems. During the pandemic, it has also had the extra work of distributing stimulus checks.</body>

	<title>Once a Trump-Basher, Mexico’s Leader Misses Him Already</title>
	<author>Natalie Kitroeff</author>
	<body>MEXICO CITY — President Trump called Mexican migrants rapists, threatened his neighbor with a trade war, kicked tens of thousands of asylum seekers out of the country, built up the border wall and promised to make Mexico pay for it.Mexico’s president is a big fan.So profound is his appreciation that when President Andrés Manuel López Obrador finally got on the phone for the first time with President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. last month, he made a point of praising the departing president.“I must mention that we do have a very good relationship with the now president of your country, Mr. Donald Trump,” Mr. López Obrador said, according to two people with knowledge of the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. “Regardless of any other considerations, he respects our sovereignty.”Concerned that Mr. Biden might be more inclined to meddle in Mexican affairs, Mr. López Obrador has spent the last several weeks preemptively poking the incoming administration in the eye.He was among the very last global leaders to congratulate Mr. Biden on his victory, insisting on waiting “until all the legal issues are resolved.” He recently signed a law gutting the ability of U.S. drug agents to act in Mexico. And then, out of nowhere, Mr. López Obrador offered Julian Assange asylum.His government also exonerated a former Mexican defense secretary charged with drug trafficking by American prosecutors, allegations the president said were “fabricated” by investigators who “did not act responsibly.”Behind all those perceived slights is a fear that the Democrats are more likely to intervene to promote labor rights and clean energy, getting in the way of Mr. López Obrador’s ambitious agenda at home, according to two officials in his government who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.“It’s like a dog at the park: He’s gnashing his teeth and threatening you and growling in the hope that you won’t come close,” said Shannon O’Neil, a Mexico expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “He’s trying to pre-emptively push back against engagement by the incoming Biden administration.”In a statement, Roberto Velasco, who oversees the North American region at Mexico’s foreign ministry, said that the government has had several conversations with Mr. Biden’s transition team “highlighting the importance that both attach to a good bilateral relationship.”He added: “Mexico will continue to work, within our Constitutional principles, to foster the best relationship between our country and the United States. Those who keep predicting bilateral conflicts will again be proved wrong.”One of the surprising twists in a Trump presidency full of them has been how a Mexican leader who ran on a leftist, populist platform and once said Mr. Trump “stokes racism” came to regard him so highly.By all appearances, the relationship is based more on pragmatism than on any deep personal friendship. The two men share a profound lack of interest in the particulars of foreign policy and found common purpose in leaving each other alone.The terms of their deal may not have been written, but they were clear. Mr. López Obrador enforced Mr. Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda and in exchange, the United States let him run Mexico as he pleased.In a recent speech in Alamo, Texas, Mr. Trump bragged about how many Mexican soldiers Mr. López Obrador had sent to police the border. “I want to thank the great president of Mexico,” he said. “He is a great gentleman, a friend of mine.”On style, too, the leaders were often aligned. Both campaigned on a promise to root out a corrupt elite, won with a coalition of voters disgusted with their country’s establishment and, once in office, painted the media and the opposition as enemies of their movement.Just as Mr. Trump used Twitter to speak directly to his base, Mr. López Obrador takes control of the narrative by holding two-hour news conferences every day at which questions are often asked by sympathetic tabloid reporters or YouTubers.And in 2006, Mr. López Obrador spent months leveling accusations of fraud after he lost the presidential election, going as far as to hold a fake inauguration for himself in the capital’s central square.“He is, in a certain sense, very similar to Trump,” said Sergio Aguayo, one of Mexico’s leading human rights activists. “The understanding between them was emotional and practical.”Mr. Biden is likely to ask more of Mr. López Obrador.The president-elect is anticipating a surge of migration from Latin America in the coming year, driven by the global economic crisis and the perception of a more sympathetic ear in the White House, according to several people familiar with his thinking. On Sunday, Guatemalan soldiers beat back a caravan of thousands of Central Americans traveling north from Honduras and hoping to reach the United States.Mexico, which mobilized extra security forces at its southern border to prepare for this latest caravan, is seen as crucial to holding off new waves of migrants. And with the pandemic still raging, the Biden administration will also need Mr. López Obrador’s cooperation in instituting more coronavirus testing and tracing for people who cross the southern border.But Mr. Biden is unlikely to resort to threats or public humiliation to get Mexico to do what he wants — and that gives Mr. López Obrador an opening to try to set the tone for a more standoffish relationship early on.While the Mexican president says he wants to maintain “a good neighbor policy” with the superpower at the border, he has also criticized his predecessors for being “servile and irresponsible in terms of enforcing our sovereignty.”In the recent blowup over Mexico’s decision not to press charges against the former Mexican defense secretary, whom the United States accuses of working for a drug cartel, Mr. López Obrador defended himself by lashing out at American officials. He accused them of conducting “an investigation so irresponsibly and without evidence.”His real goal, analysts say, may be to stoke the resentment of the Mexican public toward American intervention in the drug war.“He’s trying to activate a certain anti-American streak,” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst and associate professor at CIDE, a Mexican university. If he is successful, it may become easier to reject U.S. influence over his government.“They are going to pressure López Obrador to change certain policies,” Mr. Bravo Regidor said, “and López Obrador is going say: ‘See? They’re trying to intervene in our internal affairs. And we’re not going to allow it.’”</body>

	<title>En defensa del optimismo de Joe Biden</title>
	<author>David Brooks</author>
	<body>La mayoría de los llamados a la “unidad nacional” son palabras huecas. Son promesas poco realistas y cursis para “congregarnos” en torno a nada.Sin embargo, como escribió la semana pasada Richard Hughes Gibson en The Hedgehog Review, las discusiones son los mejores llamados a la unidad nacional. Son llamados decididos para congregarnos en torno a una idea específica de Estados Unidos, un proyecto nacional específico.¿En torno a qué idea de Estados Unidos nos pide Joe Biden que nos unamos? La antigua. Así como Walt Whitman lo entendió, Estados Unidos fue fundado en su mayoría por personas que huían de los restos del feudalismo, la casta estratificada de sociedades de Europa.Hoy tenemos un feudalismo hecho en casa. En la derecha, tenemos la supremacía blanca, un esfuerzo para perpetuar el sistema de castas raciales de Estados Unidos, y el nacionalismo cristiano, un esfuerzo para definir a Estados Unidos de una manera que elimina el pluralismo que existe en la actualidad.En la izquierda, con menos saña, están las universidades de élite que se han vuelto maquinarias para la producción de desigualdad. Toda esa postura del “despertar” es el intento del profesorado de encubrir el hecho de que trabajan en escuelas que preparan para el ingreso en la sociedad a un alumnado que proviene en su mayoría del uno por ciento más rico en la escala de ingresos, no del 60 por ciento que gana menos. Sus graduados se van en multitudes a barrios o suburbios insulares de Nueva York, D. C., San Francisco y unas cuantas ciudades más, tienen poco contacto con el resto de Estados Unidos y hacen que todos los demás se sientan despreciados e invisibles.He aquí a Joe Biden, un hombre rechazado por el feudalismo antiguo de la derecha y que no pertenece al feudalismo “meritocrático” de la izquierda. He aquí a una figura parecida a la de Truman, cuyo discurso de toma de posesión incluyó palabras sencillas y los valores simples de los estadounidenses promedio.Mi pasaje favorito fue este: “Les voy a decir algo sobre la vida: nadie sabe qué nos depara. Algunos días necesitamos que nos den una mano y otros nos toca ir a ayudar”. Los valores de Biden son la humildad, la vulnerabilidad, la compasión, la resiliencia, la interdependencia, la solidaridad. El patriotismo de Donald Trump era exagerado y basado en el miedo. El de Biden es el patriotismo basado en la seguridad en sí mismo que absorbió al criarse en un cierto tipo de país durante el siglo estadounidense.Cada presidente establece el tono moral y cultural de la nación. Durante los últimos cuatro años fuimos testigos de ello de la peor manera. Solo con ser quien es, Biden sienta las bases de un renacimiento moral. Sus valores trascienden a la guerra cultural de la izquierda y la derecha, de las urbes contra las zonas rurales que hemos vivido durante una generación. Esto comenzará a sanar a una nación rota e ingobernable. Ahora, Biden trabajará para despolitizar la vida estadounidense. A lo largo de los últimos años, la política se relacionaba con todo menos con el gobierno real. Con Trump, el partidismo tenía que ver con una identidad personal, un resentimiento de clase, una afiliación religiosa, un prejuicio racial y una animadversión cultural.Biden es un genio en separar la política de las guerras culturales. Fue un genio al evadir el circo de Trump, incluido todo el barullo que causa en la izquierda. Pasamos por una era de polarización afectiva, cuando ya no podíamos estar más en desacuerdo, solo nos odiábamos más. Con Biden, la temperatura emocional disminuirá. La gente se cree las mentiras porque hay un razonamiento motivado. Con Biden, la motivación disminuirá. Siendo honestos, necesitamos más apatía política en Estados Unidos.Biden tiene la agenda correcta, la redistribución de la dignidad. Un político puede decirles a aquellos que se han quedado rezagados que los escucha y puede decirlo de dientes para afuera. Pero Biden quiere darles un cheque de 1400 dólares que de otro modo no habrían recibido, aumentar el crédito fiscal por hijos a 3000 dólares y crear empleos en infraestructura. Esa es una prueba fehaciente de que alguien en Washington entiende por lo que los ciudadanos están pasando y va a hacer algo tangible al respecto.¿Logrará conseguir la aprobación para este tipo de legislación de gran envergadura? Estoy lejos de haber perdido la esperanza. Todos los días, leo artículos que dicen que los republicanos nunca aceptarán esos planes de gasto y siempre quiero preguntarles a los autores de esos textos: ¿se han dado cuenta de que los republicanos ya votaron para aprobar un gasto de casi 3 billones de dólares en los últimos diez meses? No subestimen lo dividido y confundido que está su partido en este momento. No subestimen lo mucho que los republicanos confían en Biden como persona.No subestimen a cuántos legisladores republicanos les gustaría enviarle un cheque a su gente. Hace poco, estaba en una llamada con el caucus bipartidista de la Cámara de Representantes que se dedica a resolver problemas y con un grupo similar de senadores. Me sorprendí del compromiso tan ferviente que tienen esos republicanos y demócratas con las filas de su partido, del nivel de destreza con el que actuaron en el Congreso dividido para restablecer el esfuerzo para el plan de rescate de la COVID-19 en diciembre, de con cuánto fervor quieren acabar con el estancamiento partidista.Si esto no funciona y los republicanos adoptan una postura de obstrucción absoluta, los demócratas deben acabar con las tácticas obstruccionistas.Las principales divisiones en la era de Biden no serán solo de izquierda contra derecha. Serán entre los artistas del performance —los que contienden a un cargo público para salir en televisión—, y los constructores —los que quieren lograr algo—. Serán entre los fantasiosos, esos que mienten y exageran, y los realistas, aquellos que se apegan a la realidad. Serán entre los narcisistas (Ted Cruz) y los institucionalistas (Chuck Schumer y Mitch McConnell).Me sorprendió cuánto me conmovió la toma de posesión de Biden. Vivimos una granizada emocional que duró cuatro años. Y, de repente, el cielo se ha despejado. Es posible que, después de este trauma, Estados Unidos resurja más transformado de lo que nos podemos imaginar.David Brooks ha sido columnista de The New York Times desde el año 2003; es autor de The Road to Character y, más recientemente, de The Second Mountain.@nytdavidbrooks</body>

	<title>Census Bureau director resigns from post one year before term ends after claims that he politicized his role.</title>
	<author>Michael Wines</author>
	<body>Steven Dillingham resigned on Monday as director of the Census Bureau, bringing an early end to a tumultuous tenure that culminated this month in charges that he had allowed politics to override policy at the nation’s premier statistical agency.Mr. Dillingham notified the White House that he would leave the agency on Wednesday, when the new Biden administration takes control of the federal government. Under federal law, his term as director had been scheduled to end in December 2021.Mr. Dillingham, who took over the agency in January 2019 after being nominated for the post by President Trump, cast himself as a seasoned statistical expert who was committed to upholding the Census Bureau’s historically nonpartisan work. He had earlier run two other federal statistical agencies and held a range of other federal positions, from the Peace Corps to the Office of Personnel Management.But while his principal task was to oversee the 2020 census, even that work was often overshadowed by the Trump administration’s yearslong effort to use the bureau’s population tallies to change the rules for reapportioning the House of Representatives and drawing political districts nationwide, largely to the benefit of Republicans.The White House installed four high-level political appointees in the Census Bureau and ordered the bureau last year to produce a state-by-state count of unauthorized immigrants so that they could be deducted from population totals used to reapportion House seats later this year.Attempting to meet that rush order, Mr. Dillingham ordered the census count itself curtailed by a month, loosing a flood of lawsuits and raising more questions about the accuracy of a population count already imperiled by the pandemic.The bureau acknowledged this month that it would be unable to produce the immigrant count sought by the administration before Mr. Trump left office. On Friday, a federal court barred the agency from producing any data related to the order before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office.Advocacy groups and Democrats in Congress began demanding Mr. Dillingham’s resignation last week after the inspector general at the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, revealed that it had opened an inquiry into his management of the agency. Whistleblowers claim that he and other political appointees had pressured career employees to complete a technical report on undocumented immigrants before the Trump administration ended despite deep concerns about its accuracy.He has sought to dispute the charges, first in a response to the inspector general and again on Monday in a blog post on the Census Bureau website.He formally announced his departure in an internal statement to Census Bureau employees, first reported by the online publication Talking Points Memo.</body>

	<title>China Wanted to Show Off Its Vaccines. It’s Backfiring.</title>
	<author>Sui-Lee Wee</author>
	<body>China’s coronavirus vaccines were supposed to deliver a geopolitical win that showcased the country’s scientific prowess and generosity. Instead, in some places, they have set off a backlash.Officials in Brazil and Turkey have complained that Chinese companies have been slow to ship the doses and ingredients. Disclosures about the Chinese vaccines have been slow and spotty. The few announcements that have trickled out suggest that China’s vaccines, while considered effective, cannot stop the virus as well as those developed by Pfizer and Moderna, the American drugmakers.In the Philippines, some lawmakers have criticized the government’s decision to buy a vaccine made by a Chinese company, Sinovac. Officials in Malaysia and Singapore, which both ordered doses from Sinovac, have had to reassure their citizens that they would approve a vaccine only if it had been proved safe and effective.“Right now, I would not take any Chinese vaccine, because there’s insufficient data,” said Bilahari Kausikan, an influential former official at Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He added that he would consider it only with “a proper report.”At least 24 countries, most of them low and middle income, signed deals with the Chinese vaccine companies because they offered access when richer nations had claimed most of the doses made by Pfizer and Moderna. But the delays in getting the Chinese vaccines and the fact that the vaccines are less effective mean that those countries may take longer to vanquish the virus.Beijing officials who had hoped the vaccines would burnish China’s global reputation are now on the defensive. State media has started a misinformation campaign against the American vaccines, questioning the safety of the Pfizer and Moderna shots and promoting the Chinese vaccines as a better alternative. It has also distributed online videos that have been shared by the anti-vaccine movement in the United States.Liu Xin, an anchor with CGTN, the state broadcaster, asked on Twitter why the foreign media had failed to “follow up” on the deaths of people in Germany who had taken one vaccine — though scientists have said the people were already seriously ill. Ms. Liu’s tweet was shared by Zhao Lijian, a top spokesman at China’s Foreign Ministry.George Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has questioned the safety of the American vaccines because their developers used new techniques rather than the traditional method embraced by Chinese makers.China had hoped its vaccines would prove it had become a scientific and diplomatic powerhouse. It remains on a par with the United States in the number of vaccines approved for emergency use or in late-stage trials. Sinopharm, a state-owned vaccine maker, and Sinovac have said they can produce up to a combined two billion doses this year, making them essential to the global fight against the coronavirus.Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, their doses can be kept at refrigerated temperatures and are more easily transported, making them appealing to the developing world. They have been doled out as aid to countries like Pakistan and the Philippines.China’s campaign has been plagued with doubts, however. Many people have memories of the country’s vaccine scandals. Several governments remain angry about Beijing’s lack of openness about the virus in the early days of the pandemic. Its efforts at the start of last year to distribute masks and protective equipment to the West came under fire amid reports of shoddy quality and the demands by Chinese officials for public thanks.A YouGov survey this month of roughly 19,000 people in 17 countries and regions showed that most were distrustful of a Covid-19 vaccine made in China. The misinformation campaign surrounding Western vaccines could further undermine its image.The delays in shipments to places like Brazil and Turkey have been the latest hitch.In Turkey, the government initially promised that 10 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine would arrive in December. Only three million did in early January, according to Fahrettin Koca, Turkey’s health minister. He did not explain the reason for the shortfall, which has been criticized by opposition politicians. The remaining doses finally arrived on Monday, according to Anadolu, Turkey’s state-run news agency.In a statement, China’s Foreign Ministry cited its needs at home, where the coronavirus has re-emerged.“Currently, China’s domestic vaccine demand is huge,” it said. “While meeting domestic demand, we are overcoming difficulties, thinking and trying ways to develop international vaccine cooperation with other countries, especially developing countries in different ways, and providing support and assistance according to their needs and within our capacity.”The sporadic outbreaks could also hinder production. Sinovac, which declined to comment, said on Friday online that it was looking for workers for a Beijing-area facility where an outbreak had frightened off potential employees.Countries like Turkey and Brazil are rolling out their immunization programs with a Sinovac vaccine because Western companies cannot deliver as quickly. But Brazil’s efforts have been delayed as well. Eduardo Pazuello, the country’s health minister, said China was not acting fast enough with the documents needed to export raw materials to Brazil.“We are making strong moves at the diplomatic level to find where that resistance is and solve the problem,” Mr. Pazuello said at a news conference on Jan. 17.On Wednesday, Rodrigo Maia, Brazil’s speaker of the house, told reporters that he had met the Chinese ambassador to Brazil, who “made it clear that there is no political obstacle, that it was a technical process that was delayed a little.”The war in Ukraine. China’s officials and its media are increasingly repeating the Kremlin’s narrative about the conflict. This joint propaganda has undercut Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and has found a receptive audience in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.Relations with Europe. Chinese leaders have often viewed Europe as the softer wing of the Western world, unable and unwilling to contest China’s rise. But as the continent reassesses its security needs, that may change — and lead to a more antagonistic stance.A strict Covid policy. As China grapples with its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic, the government is following a “zero Covid” strategy. The approach has put hundreds of millions of people’s lives on pause and could have far-reaching effects.A pause on wealth redistribution. For much of last year, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, waged a fierce campaign to narrow social inequalities and usher in a new era of “common prosperity.” Now, as the economic outlook is increasingly clouded, the Communist Party is putting its campaign on the back burner.Other vaccines are beginning to fill the gap. Brazil’s Health Ministry announced on Thursday that a previously delayed shipment of two million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would arrive the next day from India.The world was also caught off guard by the disclosure that the Sinovac vaccine may not be as effective as previously thought. Earlier, officials in Turkey said trials there showed the vaccine had a 91 percent efficacy rate. In Indonesia, it was 68 percent. In Brazil, researchers initially said its efficacy was 78 percent.Then, on Jan. 12, scientists said it had an efficacy rate of just over 50 percent, once people who experienced mild symptoms were included. That level is a hair above the threshold set by the World Health Organization to consider a vaccine effective. In a news conference last week, Sinovac’s chief executive officer, Yin Weidong, reiterated that the vaccine was 100 percent effective in preventing severe cases. He said the lower efficacy rate was a result of the trial’s focus on health care workers, who had a higher propensity of contracting Covid-19 than the general population.Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president and a critic of both China and its Covid-19 vaccines, pounced on the data. On Jan. 13, he mocked the vaccine’s efficacy rate, asking a supporter: “Is that 50 percent good?”To be sure, the Chinese vaccines have a big appeal to many countries. More than 40 countries have expressed an interest in importing Chinese vaccines, according to China’s Foreign Ministry. Several world leaders, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, have gotten a Sinovac vaccine.But the spotty and inconsistent disclosures about the vaccines remain a problem. Sinopharm has said a vaccine candidate made by its Beijing Institute of Biological Products arm has an efficacy rate of 79 percent, but it did not disclose crucial details. Sinopharm didn’t respond to a request for comment.In Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China that has ordered 7.5 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine, officials have not received an application for emergency distribution nor any data from the Chinese company.“Whether it is because they are not making enough or if they have no plans to send the vaccines to Hong Kong yet, I don’t know,” said Dr. Lau Chak Sing, who heads a Hong Kong government advisory panel on Covid-19 vaccines.Data disclosure has also been an issue in the Philippines, which has secured 25 million Sinovac vaccine doses. Risa Hontiveros, an opposition lawmaker, said President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration “continues to cram their preference for Chinese-made vaccines down the public’s throat, without emergency use approval and with inconsistent data.”Leila de Lima, a senator and opposition leader who is in prison, expressed anger that the government was paying $61 a dose, more than double what Sinovac’s partner in Indonesia is paying. The presidential palace said that that price was overstated but that it couldn’t divulge the real ones because of a confidentiality agreement.Despite the uncertainty, many people may have little choice.“I’ll have my jab,” said Kayihan Pala, a member of the Turkey Medical Association’s Covid-19 monitoring board. “I am waiting my turn, because there is no other option.”Reporting was contributed by Letícia Casado, Tiffany May, Elsie Chen and Jason Gutierrez.</body>

	<title>Word + Quiz: testator</title>
	<author>The Learning Network</author>
	<body>: a person who has made a last will and testament _________The word testator has appeared in three articles on NYTimes.com in the past six years, including on May 21, 2019, in “Did Aretha Franklin Leave Her Will Under the Couch Cushion?” by Ben Sisario and Steve Friess:When Aretha Franklin died last year, her family said that she had left no will. But, as it turns out, she may have left a few of them.In a court filing on Monday, the personal representative of Ms. Franklin’s estate disclosed that three handwritten documents had been discovered just weeks ago at Ms. Franklin’s home — one in a spiral notebook under her sofa cushions, the others in a locked cabinet — and asked a Michigan probate judge to decide whether any of them are valid wills.…. Kenneth J. Abdo, an entertainment lawyer in Minneapolis, said the documents appeared to show Ms. Franklin’s intentions, and might satisfy a Michigan law that stipulates the following conditions for a “holographic,” or handwritten will: that it need only be dated and signed, and that “the document’s material portions” must be “in the testator’s handwriting.”_________The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

	<title>Monitoring the Weather at the Edge of the World</title>
	<author>Marzena Skubatz</author>
	<body>It all started with a single sentence in a blog post about Iceland: “A farmer is looking for support at a weather station and sheep farm.”It was 2012, and, after studying photography in the industrial German city of Dortmund, I was ready for a change. I’d long planned on visiting Iceland, and when I read about the secluded farm, everything came together. I replied to the post, landed the job, sold most of my things and booked my flight.Marsibil Erlendsdottir, the farmer and weather station attendant, picked me up at the small airport in Egilsstadir, near Iceland’s easternmost edge.The drive to the weather station took nearly two hours — through snow-covered mountain passes, alongside waterfalls, past reindeer and empty summer houses. As we neared our destination, the road grew narrow and rough. Finally, we arrived at the end of an isolated fjord, where a small yellow lighthouse appeared in the distance.“Welcome to the end of the world,” Ms. Erlendsdottir said, laughing.The Icelandic Meteorological Office runs 71 manned weather stations around the country, 57 of which report the precipitation, snow depth and ground cover once per day. Ms. Erlendsdottir, who goes by Billa, oversees one of the 14 stations that also report on cloud cover, weather conditions and other meteorological phenomena.Every three hours, day and night, no matter the weather, Billa checks the readings on the weather instruments at her station and relays them — temperatures, air pressure, wind conditions, and others — to the office in Reykjavik.Her reports, along with those from the rest of the country, are published online and broadcast over the radio. For farmers who rely on the forecasts, the information Billa provides can help dictate their daily work. For fishermen on the high seas, the information can be the difference between life and death.There has been a weather station in this area since 1938, and it has always been operated by real people. (Given the region’s harsh conditions, automation wouldn’t be possible, Billa says.)The region is incredibly remote. In the coldest months of the year, the farm is only accessible by boat and, when storms hit, can be cut off from the outside world for days on end.Billa grew up at the weather station with her brother and five sisters. She married one of the local fishermen and had a family of her own, raising two children — one of whom, her son, was born on a boat on the way to the hospital.Billa’s husband died in recent years, leaving her to run the weather station and the farm on her own. Billa could easily have left the place, but she decided to stay.“It never gets boring here,” she said.I initially worked with Billa for 10 months. Having grown up on a farm in Poland, I found much of the work familiar: caring for the sheep, helping to train the Border collies, repairing fences, gathering hay.Billa doesn’t enjoy the spotlight. It took more than a year before she was comfortable enough for me to take her portrait.In the meantime, I began documenting her life and work, following the rhythm of her days — and of the weather reports.Like Billa, I enjoy spending time off the grid, and so I kept returning to the farm, where there is no cellphone reception. In total I’ve spent around two and a half years there.The area becomes especially inaccessible in the winter months, when the daylight lasts for only a few hours and the lighthouse’s constantly spinning beam cuts through the darkness.Looking ahead. As governments across the world loosen coronavirus restrictions, the travel industry hopes this will be the year that travel comes roaring back. Here is what to expect:Air travel. Many more passengers are expected to fly compared to last year. You’ll still need to check the latest entry requirements, and wear a mask for now. But more destinations will be within reach as countries reopen to tourists.Lodging. During the pandemic, many travelers discovered the privacy offered by rental residences. Hotels hope to compete again by offering stylish extended-stay properties, sustainable options, rooftop bars and co-working spaces.Rental cars. Travelers can expect higher prices, and older cars with high mileage, since companies still haven’t been able to expand their fleets. Seeking an alternative? Car-sharing platforms might be a more affordable option.Cruises. Despite a bumpy start to the year, thanks to Omicron’s surge, demand for cruises remains high. Luxury expedition voyages are particularly appealing right now, because they typically sail on smaller ships and steer away from crowded destinations.Destinations. Cities are officially back: Travelers are eager to dive into the sights, bites and sounds of a metropolis like Paris or New York. For a more relaxing time, some resorts in the U.S. are pioneering an almost all-inclusive model that takes the guesswork out of planning a vacation.Experiences. Travel options centered around sexual wellness (think couples retreats and beachfront sessions with intimacy coaches) are growing popular. Trips with an educational bent, meanwhile, are increasingly sought after by families with children.For months on end, the farm is blanketed by snow, and sounds are muted — except the sound of the surrounding sea. In winter, the crushing waves become progressively wilder, the wind ever stronger, the weather conditions less predictable.But even in the harshest snowstorm, Billa leaves her house to care for the animals and check the instrument shelter.Every season brings its own tasks. In spring, when the sheep give birth, the animals need to be monitored 24 hours a day. In summer, the hay for the winter months has to be collected. And during the autumn, the sheep are carried down from the mountains.In addition to all the farm work, Billa also maintains the lighthouse, which was built in 1908. Her store cupboard must always be well stocked, given that the nearest supermarket is 50 miles away.In the winter, it takes an hour by boat to get to the nearest shops. A mail boat comes once every two weeks, but only when the weather conditions allow it.The circumstances here are immensely demanding, but living in harmony with nature provides Billa with a sense of inner peace. She can’t sit still and spends as much time as possible outside.A few years ago, Billa’s daughter, Adalheidur, who goes by Heida, finished her studies in Reykjavik and moved back to the farm to accompany and help her mother.“If I ever moved away, my mother would definitely stay here on her own,” Heida said.“Here,” she added, “she feels free.”Marzena Skubatz is a photographer based in Germany and Iceland.

	<title>Five Takeaways From the Developing Space War Between China and the U.S.</title>
	<author>William J. Broad</author>
	<body>The stars of the new space age include not only famous entrepreneurs but a rising generation of dreamers and doers. Small companies, developing states and even high schools now loft spacecraft into orbit.But Beijing is intent on dominating the democratized space age. It is building ground-based lasers that can zap spacecraft and rehearsing cyberattacks meant to sever the Pentagon from its orbital fleets. Seven years ago, Washington seized on a new strategy for strengthening the United States military’s hand in a potential space war. The plan evolved during the Obama and Trump administrations and, it is expected to intensify under President Biden.Here’s how the fight over space got started and how it is now playing out:In 2007, China shattered one of its own derelict satellites into thousands of whirling shards, making global headlines. The message to Washington was clear: Beijing was a vigorous new rival.China conducted about a dozen more tests after the 2007 foray. Some of the speeding warheads shot much higher, in theory putting most classes of American spacecraft at risk.But Beijing has also sought to diversify its antisatellite force beyond warheads.The insight was simple. Every aspect of American space power was controlled from the ground by powerful computers. If penetrated, the brains of Washington’s space fleets could be degraded or destroyed. Moreover, such attacks were remarkably cheap compared to other antisatellite arms.China began developing viruses to infect enemy computers and, in 2005, began to incorporate cyberattacks into its military exercises. Increasingly, its military doctrine called for paralyzing early attacks.The idea is that advances in the commercial sector can do for U.S. space forces what Steve Jobs did for terrestrial gadgets. To counter the Chinese threat, the Obama administration sought to tap the breakthroughs of space innovators as a way to reinvigorate the military.Washington pumped billions of dollars into commercial ventures like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. The result was the development of swarms of tiny satellites as well as fleets of reusable rockets, innovations that were seen as making antisatellite targeting vastly more difficult if not impossible.The Trump administration continued the Obama commercial strategy, though neither the White House nor the newly created Space Force publicly acknowledged its origin.President Donald J. Trump also sought to acquire offensive arms. The Space Force took possession of its first offensive weapon, which fires beams of energy from sites on the ground to disrupt enemy spacecraft in orbit.The Trump administration last year asked Congress for a start on what it called counter-space weapons, putting their expected cost at many hundreds of millions of dollars. The military’s classified budget for the offensive abilities is said to run much higher.Lloyd J. Austin III, a retired four-star Army general who was confirmed last week as Mr. Biden’s secretary of defense, told the Senate that he would keep a “laserlike focus” on maintaining and sharpening the U.S. “competitive edge” against China’s increasingly powerful military. Among other things, he called for new American investment in “space-based platforms” and repeatedly referred to space as a war-fighting domain.Mr. Austin cited a need for enhanced orbital resilience, as well as continued reliance on the innovations of space entrepreneurs as a means of strengthening the military’s hand. The menacing new era, he said, highlighted the importance of “improving our war-fighting capability” in outer space. And he singled out China as “the pacing threat.”</body>

	<title>The Fire Last Time</title>
	<author>Elizabeth Bruenig</author>
	<body>Robert Pruett was 17 when he was sentenced to 99 years in prison for being party to his father’s fatal stabbing of a neighbor in 1995. Five years later, Mr. Pruett was sent to death row after being convicted of stabbing a guard to death.Prosecutors said the guard, Daniel Nagle, was filing a disciplinary complaint against Mr. Pruett — a motive for murder. But no physical evidence was ever produced to link Mr. Pruett to the slaying. He was instead convicted largely on eyewitness testimony from inmates, who Mr. Pruett’s lawyers say were compensated with favorable deals from the prosecution.Years later, Mr. Pruett’s lawyers claimed in a court filing, it emerged that when Mr. Nagle was killed, he was preparing to file a grievance against fellow guards who were later arrested after being accused of forming a money-laundering ring with inmates at the prison. One of those guards, Eliseo Martinez, was among the first prison officials to implicate Mr. Pruett in Mr. Nagle’s murder.Evidently persuaded by these facts, a judge on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals wrote that “it appears there may be significant problems with the evidence of guilt and with the imposition of the death penalty in this case.”But it didn’t matter. That court — and many others — let Mr. Pruett’s execution go ahead.By then, there was little to stop it. Around the time Mr. Pruett was first jailed, the government had gutted inmates’ rights to appeal to federal courts.“It’s not enough to show that the state has virtually no evidence against your client,” said Mr. Pruett’s lawyer David R. Dow. “You have to actually prove they’re innocent. That’s proving a negative. It’s a very hard thing to do.”And in the end, it could not be done. Mr. Pruett was executed in October of 2017.Born into deprivation, Mr. Pruett may never have had much of a chance at life, but whatever remained of his prospects was extinguished not on the day Mr. Nagle was killed but four years earlier, when a right-wing terrorist committed mass murder on the plains of Oklahoma, setting off a legislative chain reaction that would seal the fates of many death row inmates who had nothing to do with terrorism.*On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated some 7,000 pounds of fertilizer, industrial solvent, and stolen explosives in a Ryder moving truck outside the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 infants and children in the building’s on-site day care center. Hundreds more were injured. As black smoke poured from the bowels of the building on television screens across the country, legislators resolved to act.Americans were outraged by the attack, as they had been by the bombing of the World Trade Center two years earlier. They were horrified by the broader symbolic assault on the American project itself. Mr. McVeigh’s ideology was a noxious medley of grievances echoed this month by many in the mob that sacked the Capitol after President Trump’s incitement.Now, stunned by the attack on Congress, commentators and legislators are again poring over our antiterrorism statutes, wondering what more needs to be done to prevent another such travesty.But the lessons of the Oklahoma City bombing’s aftermath ought to serve as a warning: Rushing to pass antiterrorism legislation in the wake of a shocking assault may or may not stop future violence, but it can easily foreclose the rights of citizens, including some of the most vulnerable ones — inmates in our country’s prisons.*Political pressure for a legislative response to the Oklahoma City bombing began as the rubble was being cleared. In a decade already racked with anxiety about terrorism and violent crime, the heightened visibility of incidents involving home-brewed extremism, like the siege of David Koresh’s Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, added a nightmarish new element to America’s fears. With a strong public mandate, the Republican-controlled Congress set to work with a good deal of leverage against the Democratic president, Bill Clinton, given the upcoming election. By 1996, roughly a year after the carnage in Oklahoma, Mr. Clinton signed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (A.E.D.P.A.) into law.The law was a bipartisan affair expedited by Republican interest in stifling challenges to the death penalty, and inflamed by concern that Mr. McVeigh would evade capital punishment at trial. (In fact, he requested that all further appeals of his execution be halted, then fruitlessly pursued a stay of execution later for ostensibly ideological reasons.) Elements of the new law ensured that lengthy appeals and legal maneuvering could not protect convicts sentenced to die from meeting a speedy end.To accomplish that, the law transformed the writ of habeas corpus.Habeas corpus is a Latin term describing a prisoner’s right to go to court to protest unlawful imprisonment. Embraced by America’s founders, the Great Writ, as it’s colloquially known, is enshrined in the Constitution, statutory law, and case law, where it guarantees certain rights to the detained. Habeas corpus entitles detainees convicted in state courts to appeal to federal courts if they believe their rights were violated at trial or during sentencing. During the 1960s, the Supreme Court expanded those rights — one reason Republicans were so eager to limit them in the A.E.D.P.A.The new law imposed a one-year deadline on state prisoners seeking relief in federal courts, which John Blume, a Cornell Law School professor and the director of the school's Death Penalty Project, wrote, “has deprived thousands of inmates of any federal review of their convictions, and in some cases, their death sentences.” It limited petitioners to a single challenge in federal court. It made it harder for appellants to present facts in federal court that had not been presented in state courts — the provision that doomed Mr. Pruett.Perhaps the most egregious change was a provision that required federal judges to pay strict deference to state court decisions. That aspect of the law, Mr. Blume told me, has “been interpreted by the Supreme Court to say that a federal court can’t order a new trial for a state prisoner just because they think the state court got it wrong. It has to be so wrong that no reasonable jurist could have come to that conclusion. So some people call it deference — it’s a deference provision to state court — but it’s been interpreted by the court to basically almost require abdication.”Mr. Dow, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center and a founder of the Texas Innocence Network, has studied the impact of the A.E.D.P.A. on capital punishment for over a decade. Since the passage of the act, he told me, executions have been carried out more quickly. He said the law also led to a significant decline in successful petitions for relief filed by death row inmates.“Insofar as the published cases reveal,” Mr. Dow wrote in a 2009 chapter written with Eric M. Freedman of Hofstra University’s law school, “the success rate for capital inmates on federal habeas has fallen dramatically — to levels about a fifth what they previously were.”While a study cited by Mr. Dow and Jeffrey Newberry, a legal clinic supervisor at the University of Houston Law Center, in a U.C.L.A. Law Review article found that almost 40 percent of federal capital habeas proceedings were successful from 1973 to 1995, the world the A.E.D.P.A. created looks sharply different. Between 2000 and 2020, they found, of the 151 death row inmates who pursued federal habeas relief in Texas, only one was successful.*Aspects of the law did address terrorism. It allowed for the prosecution of people who provided funds, recruitment or shelter to known terrorist groups, regardless of whether they directly participated in any terrorist act. It made financial transactions with countries known to support international terrorism illegal. It also included provisions for supporting victims of terrorism.But the law was never concerned strictly with terrorism. Tung Yin, a professor at Lewis and Clark Law School whose research focuses on national security and terrorism law, told me the law amounted to a “kind of grab bag of all kinds of things,” some of which had been on legislators’ wish lists for some time.In that sense, Mr. Yin said, it resembled its spiritual successor, the Patriot Act. With the A.E.D.P.A. and the Patriot Act in the rear view, he added, “there’s always a concern, I think, to passing legislation quickly in the face of some kind of very shocking and horrifying events.” Mr. Blume echoed his concern. The people who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6 “need to be punished. They need to be caught. They need to be convicted,” he said. “But we have enough, plenty of stuff on the books, to do that. We don’t need to do anything that’s going to just add to the mass incarceration problem that we already have in this country.”“I think the idea that we need some new set of criminal laws in order to deal with this sort of mayhem that we witnessed over the last week is really just kind of crazy,” Mr. Dow agreed earlier this month. “Laws that are enacted with the ostensible target of one very specific iteration of some type of crime become much broader in their application and sometimes leave the original intentions behind entirely.”Timothy McVeigh was executed only a few months before the Sept. 11 attacks would usher in yet another round of antiterrorism laws with effects far exceeding their ostensible targets. He had contended that the United States government was tyrannical, murderous. He did not live long enough to see his convictions affirmed.Elizabeth Bruenig (@ebruenig) is an Opinion writer.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Your Tuesday Briefing</title>
	<author>Melina Delkic</author>
	<body>Good morning.We’re covering glitches in India’s vaccination campaign, China’s economic resilience during the pandemic and a Covid-19 hospital failure in Egypt.India’s coronavirus vaccine rollout, one of the largest in the world, has been hobbled by technical glitches in a mobile phone application, leaving the country far short of its vaccination goals in the first few days of the campaign.State officials complained of problems with a digital platform called the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network, or CoWIN, which is used by vaccine providers and recipients to monitor progress. Vaccine recipients have to sign up through the app.The software became overwhelmed and didn’t work at many vaccination sites as the campaign began on Saturday. India is planning to vaccinate 1.3 billion people, as it battles the second-highest case count and third-highest death count in the world.Details: On the first day, about 300,000 health care workers were set to be inoculated; the actual number was about 207,000. On Sunday, the number dropped to 17,072.Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.In other developments:Australia’s health secretary said the country was unlikely to fully reopen its borders in 2021, despite vaccination efforts and pressure from the tourism industry.Nearly one year after the virus was first detected in the U.S., the country reached another milestone in cases and is hurtling toward 400,000 total deaths.In Japan, the health ministry reported three new cases on Monday of the variant that spread in Britain, the first to be discovered among residents with no travel history.As most nations around the world struggle with new lockdowns and layoffs during the pandemic, only one major economy has bounced back after bringing the coronavirus mostly under control: China.The economy grew 2.3 percent last year, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics announced on Monday. By contrast, the U.S., Japan and many nations in Europe are expected to report steep falls in output. Exports and infrastructure have fueled the growth.Despite the good news for China, the growth figures were still the lowest in 40 years. And there are pockets of weakness, like the lack of jobs for recent college graduates with little experience. Hotels and restaurants in inland provinces have not fully recovered like those in the major cities.Obstacles: So much of China’s success in the past year stemmed from its ability to stamp out the coronavirus — but new outbreaks are challenging that resilience. The authorities are starting to reimpose a wide variety of health checks that are discouraging consumers from spending money.As President Trump prepares to leave office this week, the chaos that reached a fever pitch in the final weeks will outlast his tenure. There are now more troops stationed in Washington than in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Somalia; the coronavirus is ravaging the country; and an impeachment trial looms.It’s unclear when Speaker Nancy Pelosi will formally send the article of impeachment to the Senate, but once she does the chamber has to immediately move to begin the trial.A slim Senate majority will allow Democrats to move ahead more easily on pandemic relief and cabinet appointments. Senators are scheduled to begin confirmation hearings this week, and they will do so with a phalanx of heavily armed National Guard troops nearby.Biden’s first plans: President-elect Joe Biden plans to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline permit on his first day in office, amid a flurry of executive orders.A video showing coronavirus patients at a hospital struggling to get oxygen went viral on social media this month, drawing outrage across Egypt. Four people died that night, when Ahmed Nafei, a relative of one of the patients, pulled out his phone and began filming, but the government denied that the hospital had run out of oxygen.Our investigative reporters talked to witnesses and analyzed the footage showing that an oxygen shortage was the result of a cascade of problems at the hospital. “The whole world can admit there’s a problem, but not us,” one doctor said.Aleksei Navalny: A judge ordered the Russian opposition leader to be jailed for 30 days, pending a trial. Mr. Navalny was arrested late Sunday upon his arrival in Moscow from Germany, where he was recovering from a nerve-agent attack.TV drama in India: Bollywood once again has fallen into the cross hairs of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, as politicians file criminal complaints against the Amazon web series “Tandav.” Among other objections, they accused the series of disrespecting Hindu gods, belittling members of individual castes and sullying the office of the prime minister.Samsung chief jailed: A court sentenced Lee Jae-yong, the vice chairman who runs the sprawling conglomerate, to two and a half years in prison for bribing Park Gyun-hye, the president who was impeached in 2016 on corruption charges.Snapshot: Above, a virtual NASCAR race. When the pandemic shut down motorsports, the industry turned to simulated racing. No one knew if digital cars would draw viewers and pay off for sponsors, but 10 months in, the gamble seems to be paying off.What we’re looking at: This Twitter thread of animals interrupting wildlife photographers. It’s a wonderful pick-me-up.Cook: This loose interpretation of spanakopita, the classic Greek spinach and feta pie, combines pasta with gooey mozzarella, briny feta, plenty of greens and a rich cream sauce.Listen: Olivia Rodrigo’s new single, “Drivers License,” which holds the single-day streaming record on Spotify, and other new tracks from Flo Milli and Lana Del Rey are among the recent picks for our pop critics’ playlist.Do: The new year is a good time to focus on paying down credit card balances, even if you are carrying less credit card debt than you were before the pandemic.You can find more recommendations on what to read, cook, watch and do while staying safe at home in our At Home collection.The past couple of weeks have been full of tense moments not only in Washington, but also in state legislative buildings where armed groups of pro-Trump protesters have gathered. Our reporters documented what they saw on the ground on Sunday.Lansing, Mich: A small group of people armed with military-style weapons gathered in front of the State Capitol on Sunday morning, but with National Guard troops and State Police surrounding the building, nearly all of the protesters who had shown up were gone by early afternoon. “That’s why I’m here, because my vote got stolen,” one attendee said.Salem, Ore.: Five men dressed in military-style clothing marched onto the grounds of the park across the street from the Oregon State Capitol around 10:30 a.m. They waved flags, including an upside-down American flag, and one held a “Disarm the Government!” sign made with marker on a white poster. “We always end up losing rights, whoever’s in office,” one protester said.Austin, Texas: The Texas State Capitol had been closed out of concerns over the protest. Armed officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety patrolled the rolling Capitol grounds and guarded the entrance to the nearby governor’s mansion. “The only reason I’m here is to ensure that no one storms the Capitol,” one attendee said. “If they do, I’ll get in front of them and be trampled.”That’s it for this briefing.

	<title>Biden Signs Executive Order Bolstering ‘Buy American’ Provisions</title>
	<author>Michael D. Shear</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — President Biden signed an executive order on Monday aimed at strengthening “Buy American” provisions that encourage the federal government to purchase goods and services from U.S. companies, a move that labor unions and manufacturing supporters cheered but that some critics said could raise costs for the federal government.Mr. Biden, speaking at the White House, cast the move as a first step in what he and his administration have promised will be an aggressive push to steer more federal dollars to American suppliers and to rebuild domestic manufacturing in industries that have dwindled in recent decades.The order — and the push to bolster American manufacturing — mirrors several Buy American directives issued by Mr. Biden’s predecessor in the White House, Donald J. Trump. But Mr. Biden and his allies tried to distinguish his efforts from what they called the failed policies of the Trump administration.“The previous administration did not take it seriously enough. Federal agencies waived the Buy American requirement without much pushback at all,” Mr. Biden said before signing the order. “That is going to change on our watch.”Supporters of Mr. Biden’s order said it would strengthen Buy American requirements far more than Mr. Trump’s efforts had, particularly when coupled with another order Mr. Biden issued last week to invoke the Defense Production Act to speed the production of coronavirus tests, personal protective equipment and other tools to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.But they also said the president’s unilateral actions were far less important for bolstering domestic manufacturing than the Buy American rules his administration has promised to include in an infrastructure proposal next month, which is expected to include trillions of dollars in new federal spending.Mr. Biden’s efforts on P.P.E. and Buy American, “coupled with the Defense Production Act, it all works together” to help rebuild domestic supply chains, said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. The infrastructure proposal, Mr. Brown said, “is the biggest thing of all.”Existing law already requires the government to contract with American companies when possible, but there are many exceptions and waiver opportunities that for years have frustrated advocates for small and medium-size businesses.Previous administrations, including Mr. Trump’s, have tried to clamp down on the process in the hopes of directing more federal dollars toward an American work force that sometimes struggles to compete with cheap goods and services imported from abroad. Mr. Trump issued several Buy American orders, as recently this month, before he left office. That order is now paused under a regulatory freeze Mr. Biden issued last week.Some economists and budget policy experts oppose Buy American requirements, saying they raise costs for the federal government and reduce the availability of products it can buy, sometimes causing delays in procurement projects, because in many cases there is not sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity to supply what the government needs.Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said on Monday that Mr. Biden’s order was unlikely to do much to help domestic manufacturers produce more and create jobs.“There’s a legal reality they’re going to run into, as the Trump administration did,” Mr. Lincicome said. “There’s also an economic reality. There’s only so much global supply chains are going to allow.”Mr. Biden said on Monday that his order would go further than previous efforts by reducing opportunities for waivers from the Buy American requirements and by tightening standards that would result in fewer federal contracts being awarded to overseas companies.His aides acknowledged that the changes would take time. Mr. Biden’s executive order will direct agencies to re-evaluate the current Buy American procedures and will set a deadline by which they are required to report their findings back to the White House for consideration.Mr. Biden also said he would create a position at the White House’s Office of Management and Budget to oversee the revisions to the  requirements, in order to add more accountability to the waiver process.The order will also require a review of that  process. And it calls on the government to examine the way in which a company’s “domestic content” is measured in the hopes of closing loopholes that companies use to claim that their goods and services are made in America.“If an agency wants to issue a waiver saying we are not going to buy an American product, we are going to buy a foreign product, they have to come to the White House and explain it to us,” Mr. Biden said. “We are going to require waivers be publicly posted. If someone is building a particular vehicle or facility and they are going to buy the following foreign parts, that waiver, the request is going to be posted. Then we will work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, ‘I can do that here in my shop in my town.’”Democratic senators from the industrial Midwest, including Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Mr. Brown, have pushed Mr. Biden to act swiftly to reduce the number of waivers and increase transparency in the waiver process. They praised his order on Monday and said it was a contrast with Mr. Trump.“It’s going to make a very significant difference, in my mind,” Ms. Baldwin, a longtime proponent of Buy American provisions, said in an interview.Unlike Mr. Trump, she said, Mr. Biden was “following up the talk with action.”Union leaders also celebrated the move. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said the order would lift the economy. Rory L. Gamble, the president of the United Auto Workers, said it “commits the vast power of the U.S. government to U.S.-citizen-made products.”</body>

	<title>La política tecnológica de Biden: oportunidades y desafíos</title>
	<author>Shira Ovide</author>
	<body>El presidente Joe Biden hereda complicadas situaciones tecnológicas, entre ellas idear una manera de frenar a las poderosas superestrellas digitales, diseñar una estrategia respecto a la tecnología china y lograr que más estadounidenses se conecten a internet.[Este artículo es parte del boletín en inglés On Tech. Puedes inscribirte aquí para recibirlo]A continuación, ofrecemos un vistazo a las oportunidades y desafíos de la política tecnológica para el nuevo gobierno de Biden:Restricción a las potencias tecnológicasDurante el gobierno de Trump, hubo investigaciones, demandas y ruidosas disputas sobre el poder de Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple y otras empresas tecnológicas. Los gigantes tecnológicos pueden esperar más de lo mismo con Biden, además de un Congreso controlado por los demócratas con un margen muy reducido.Las demandas gubernamentales que acusaban a Google y Facebook de infringir la ley para tener éxito o mantenerlo pasarán a manos de la nueva administración, que se espera que las continúe. También podrían llegar más demandas, lo que posiblemente dificulte que las grandes compañías tecnológicas sigan como hasta ahora.El 19 de enero, un abogado del Departamento de Justicia nombrado por el expresidente Donald Trump estuvo de acuerdo con muchas de las recomendaciones de los demócratas del Congreso que dijeron que las cuatro principales superpotencias tecnológicas de Estados Unidos son monopolios dañinos. El discurso demostró que odiar a las grandes empresas tecnológicas es una de las pocas áreas en las que ambos partidos están de acuerdo.La expresión en internetEsta era una disputa central en internet mucho antes de que Facebook y Twitter bloquearan las cuentas de Trump por incitar a una turba. La cuestión de qué debe hacer el gobierno, si es que debe hacer algo, con respecto a la expresión en línea es cada vez más complicada.Esta lucha política se ha enfocado en una ley fundamental de internet de 1996, la Sección 230 de la Ley de Decencia en las Comunicaciones, que da a los sitios web cierta protección legal por lo que hacen sus usuarios. Esto significa que el sitio Yelp puede permitir que la gente deje sus opiniones y filtrarlas en busca de fraude o maldad, sin tener que rendir cuentas legalmente a los propietarios de restaurantes insatisfechos por las críticas. Sin embargo, la ley también protege a los sitios web donde las personas publican fotografías sexualmente explícitas de sus exparejas sin permiso.Tanto demócratas como republicanos tienen desconfianza sobre la Sección 230, pero no por las mismas razones. Los de derecha han dicho que la ley da a las empresas de internet demasiado margen de maniobra para intervenir en lo que dice la gente en línea. Los demócratas, incluyendo a Biden, han dicho que esas compañías tienen demasiada cobertura para no intervenir en las publicaciones perjudiciales.El malestar con la Sección 230 aumenta la probabilidad de al menos algunas modificaciones. Estas podrían incluir la anulación de las protecciones legales para los sitios que alojan información errónea sobre las votaciones u obligar a las empresas a ser claras sobre los criterios que emplean para moderar sus publicaciones.China y la tecnologíaLa torpeza del gobierno de Trump respecto a las aplicaciones chinas, incluida TikTok, fue una oportunidad perdida para abordar una cuestión importante: ¿qué debe hacer el gobierno de Estados Unidos con respecto a la tecnología de importancia mundial procedente de países que no comparten los valores estadounidenses?Biden parece estar de acuerdo con las preocupaciones del gobierno de Trump sobre las ambiciones de China en materia de tecnología y otras áreas, pero no ha hecho más que insinuar que se propone formular una política más consistente y coherente. El presidente también ha expresado su apoyo a una mayor inversión gubernamental en tecnología esencial de Estados Unidos para contrarrestar las ambiciones tecnológicas de China.Brecha digitalLa pandemia evidenció una brecha persistente entre los estadounidenses que pueden acceder a un servicio de internet y pagarlo y los millones que no pueden, especialmente en los hogares de bajos ingresos o rurales.Las prioridades de Biden mencionan la “banda ancha universal”, pero no ha especificado cómo lograrlo. The Washington Post informó que los asesores de Biden quieren mejorar E-Rate, un programa para ayudar a las escuelas y bibliotecas a proporcionar acceso a internet.¿Qué más?El plan de reactivación económica de Biden incluye sugerencias para “lanzar el esfuerzo más ambicioso jamás realizado” con el fin de modernizar las ciberdefensas de Estados Unidos. ¿Quizá este sea el año de una ley federal de privacidad de datos? Además, hay desavenencias entre los demócratas sobre el tema de un modelo laboral especial para los trabajadores de la economía colaborativa.Las prioridades más urgentes para el nuevo gobierno son acabar con la pandemia y ayudar a los estadounidenses a recuperarse de la crisis. Sin embargo, la forma en que el gobierno de Estados Unidos maneje estas complejas cuestiones tecnológicas también tendrá un gran efecto en los estadounidenses y en otros países del mundo.</body>

	<title>A vaccine ad invokes the culture of Mardi Gras to reduce hesitancy.</title>
	<author>Jan Hoffman</author>
	<body>With the snap of the snare drums, New Orleanians take joyous turns high-stepping and chicken strutting, dressed in the finery of their social clubs and krewes. The celebration, shown on a 30-second public service announcement, is one of numerous efforts around the country to persuade people to get inoculated against the coronavirus. But its homegrown approach, using neighborhood personas and invoking local Carnival culture, may make it particularly effective, say experts in vaccine hesitance and behavioral change.“I’m getting the vaccine so we can have Mardi Gras, y’all!” shouts Jeremy Stevenson, a Monogram Hunter Mardi Gras Indian, also known as Second Chief Lil Pie, as he sways in a 12-foot tower of turquoise feathers and beading.Other locals prance forth to offer their own reasons, concluding: “Sleeves Up, NOLA!”“I teared up several times and also just laughed out loud with delight. The sense of community is contagious,” said Alison M. Buttenheim, the scientific director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. “Vaccination is framed as a collective action that everyone can contribute to in order to bring back things the community values and cherishes.”Although national vaccine hesitation rates are falling, surveys show that antipathy to the new shots is still widespread among some demographic groups. But there has been little consensus around ways to build confidence in the shot.In November, New Orleans put together a coalition of public health doctors, clergy, leaders from Black, Latino and Vietnamese communities, and heads of the city’s large social clubs. The group identified cultural icons that would appeal widely to residents.Rather than focusing messaging on the miseries wrought by the pandemic, it decided to emphasize an aspirational and inviting tone, a core insight derived from behavioral change research.“I’m getting my shot so I can visit my 92-year-old mom and we can eat in our favorite restaurants,” says Julie Nalibov of the Krewe of Red Beans.The spot will be shown on local TV stations and saturate social media. Photographs will adorn citywide billboards.“I hope state and local health departments around the country can get resources to develop more hyperlocal campaigns,” Dr. Buttenheim said. “Imagine similar spots from Philly, or Boise, or Hawaii, or the Cherokee Nation.”</body>

	<title>Deborah Rhode, Who Transformed the Field of Legal Ethics, Dies at 68</title>
	<author>Clay Risen</author>
	<body>Deborah L. Rhode, a law professor who transformed the field of legal ethics from little more than a crib sheet for passing the bar exam into an empirically rich, morally rigorous investigation into how lawyers should serve the public, died on Jan. 8 at her home in Stanford, Calif. She was 68.Her husband, Ralph Cavanagh, confirmed her death but said the cause had not yet been determined.With 30 books and some 200 law review articles to her name, Professor Rhode, who spent over four decades teaching at Stanford, was by far the most-cited scholar in legal ethics, with a work ethic that astounded even her hard-charging colleagues.“She was done with all her chapters before I started mine,” said David J. Luban, a law professor at Georgetown and one of her co-authors on “Legal Ethics,” a casebook now in its eighth edition.To Professor Rhode, the core issues in legal ethics were not about bar association rules, but the politics and interests behind those rules, especially those that limited who could practice law and how lawyers should go about providing services to people who could not afford them.“In her view, it wasn’t enough to memorize rules or espouse airy principles,&quot; said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a fellow law professor at Stanford. “Legal ethics — and legal ethics scholars — would have to refocus on what matters: access to justice, integrity, accountability, and equality.”Professor Rhode was a relentless critic of the American Bar Association, which she believed was too focused on barriers to entry that undermined innovation and kept legal fees high. Such was her intellectual standing that in 2014 the association nevertheless gave her its Outstanding Scholar Award.She was equally concerned with issues of gender in the legal profession, a subject she knew well from deep personal experience. As one of a handful of women at Yale Law School in the mid-1970s, and later as only the second woman to receive tenure at Stanford Law School, she found herself constantly harassed, demeaned and excluded by colleagues.When she arrived at Stanford in 1979, she had wanted to teach gender and the law, but the dean refused, telling her to pick a “real subject,” as she recalled. She agreed to teach contracts instead, but changed her mind two years later when the dean retired and several alumni threw him a party — and invited a stripper.“I said to hell with contracts,” she later wrote.But progress on gender-equity issues brought its own complications. As women made their way into law firms and legal faculties, among other professions, during the 1980s and ’90s, it became easy to conclude that sex discrimination had disappeared, or was fast on its way to disappearing — what Professor Rhode referred to as the “no-problem problem.”Through law review articles and countless opinion pieces in publications like The New York Times, The New Republic and Slate, she documented the barriers that women still faced, among them unconscious bias, unequal pay, lack of mentors, stereotypes and inflexible workplace structures.In 2000 she wrote an Op-Ed for The Times about her distaste for high heels and the social mores that demand that women wear them. The article became the seed for one of her best-known books, “The Beauty Bias: The Injustice of Appearance in Life and Law” (2010).Indeed, many of her books, which ranged far beyond gender and legal ethics into topics like leadership, character and ambition, were rooted in her own experience. “What Dogs Deserve” a forthcoming book about how the law treats canine companions, sprang from her relationship with her cocker spaniel, Stanton.“It’s amazing how prolific she was,” said Leslie C. Levin, a professor of legal ethics at the University of Connecticut. “She would look at things people take for granted and show what was wrong with it.”Deborah Lynn Rhode was born on Jan. 29, 1952, in Evanston, Ill., and grew up in the nearby Chicago suburbs of Wilmette and Kenilworth. Her father, Frederick Rhode, was an advertising executive, and her mother, Hertha (Hartung) Rhode, was a social worker.She is survived by her husband and her sister, Christine Rhode.Ms. Rhode attended New Trier East High School, where she was a champion debater, often facing off against another future legal star, Merrick Garland, the federal judge nominated to be attorney general in the Biden administration; he attended Niles West High School nearby.Arriving at Yale in 1970 as part of what was only the school’s second coed class, she found herself with almost no female professors or organizations dedicated to women’s issues. Female undergraduates, she later wrote, were intended to be seen and not heard.But she made sure that she was heard. She was the first woman elected president of the Yale Debate Association, following in the footsteps of John Kerry and William F. Buckley Jr. and defeating her future husband, Mr. Cavanagh, by a resounding 23 to 3 vote.“I followed her with keen interest after that,” Mr. Cavanagh said in an interview.Despite her academic success, Ms. Rhode continued to confront obstacles based on her gender. Although Yale was coed, the Yale Club in New York City was not. When she insisted on entering anyway, she was escorted out. She also found it difficult to land clerkships; many judges more or less refused to hire women.Two who didn’t were Judge Murray I. Gurfein, of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, for whom she worked after graduating, and Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court, where Ms. Rhode took an office down the hall from her old debating adversary, Mr. Garland, a clerk for Justice William Brennan.Justice Marshall encouraged her interest in becoming a law professor, though he teased her about teaching gender discrimination. “In most of the country,” he joked, “it seems to come naturally.”For several years Professor Rhode was one of only two women out of 38 members of the Stanford law faculty, and she often bore the weight of institutional sexism. Colleagues often confused the two women — despite the fact that Professor Rhode, blonde and petite, looked nothing like Barbara Babcock, the other female professor, who was taller and brunette. When the two circulated a letter urging the school to hire more women, colleagues demeaned it as the “Barbara and Deb need a friend” memo, she later said.Professor Rhode persisted, and her prolific scholarship and mentoring of female students and junior faculty began to change the gender demographics of the law school — and, more broadly, to challenge the insidious ways that sex discrimination persisted in a society that claimed to be overcoming it.She remained a fierce debater. When, in 1990, Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School had to pull out of a public debate with her over the ethics of the adversary system, she went ahead solo, presenting both sides — and two rebuttals — walking calmly from one podium to the other between speeches.Two of her first major books, “Justice and Gender: Sex Discrimination and the Law” (1989) and “Speaking of Sex: The Denial of Gender Inequality” (1997), established her as a leading authority on the subject. In 1998, when Richard A. Gephardt, then the House minority leader, was gearing up for the Clinton impeachment hearings, he asked an aide to locate the top expert on legal ethics and gender. Soon Professor Rhode found herself in Washington as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee.Among her duties, Professor Rhode had to review the tapes that the former White House employee Linda Tripp secretly made of conversations with her friend Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern caught up in the Clinton sex scandal, and remove any sexual material irrelevant to the proceedings. Having taken an oath of secrecy, Ms. Rhode refused to tell even her husband about the salacious details, except to say that there were a lot.Despite publishing so much, Professor Rhode put a priority on her teaching — her graceful, often witty lectures could be peppered with references to Sartre and “House of Cards” — and on her colleagues, especially new faculty members.“Soon after I started, she burst into my office and said, ‘We’re going to go on a walk once a week,’” Professor Engstrom said. “She would ask me about what I was working on, what issues I had in the classroom.”She didn’t take no for an answer. Once, when Professor Engstrom begged off, saying she didn’t have walking shoes, Professor Rhode promptly handed her a pair of her own.Professor Rhode was prolific enough that she still has two books waiting for publication. Along with “What Dogs Deserve” there is “Ambition,” scheduled for publication this spring.In it, she writes about what constitutes happiness.“Enduring satisfaction,” she writes, “is most often a byproduct of participating in worthwhile activities that do not have happiness as their primary goal. Ultimate fulfillment comes from a sense of remaining true to core ideals and principles, and of using life for something of value that outlasts it.”</body>

	<title>New India-China Border Clash Shows Simmering Tensions</title>
	<author>Hari Kumar</author>
	<body>NEW DELHI — Indian and Chinese troops have clashed along their disputed Himalayan border, according to media and military reports on Monday, as Beijing quietly intensifies pressure against its southern neighbor with new incursions into territory claimed by both sides.Details about the latest skirmish remain foggy, and Indian officials played down the events. Indian media outlets and independent military analysts said that the clash happened several days ago, and that soldiers on both sides were wounded, although no fatalities were reported.The Indian Army has said only that a “minor face-off” occurred last week in northern Sikkim, a mountainous Indian state bordering China.The face-off was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols,” an Indian Army statement read, without explaining how the face-off occurred or whether anyone was injured.Chinese officials were even more tight-lipped. At a regularly scheduled news conference on Monday, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, emphasized that the two sides were holding military talks. Hu Xijin, the editor of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Communist Party, called the reports “fake news” and said that small frictions occur often.Though details were scant, reports of a clash show that tensions are still simmering between the two Asian giants, which fought a war in 1962 and have been eyeing each other warily across their unresolved frontier ever since. Tensions burst into the open in June, when troops from both countries engaged in a deadly brawl along the border of the Ladakh region in northern India.No shots were fired in that battle, stemming from a tacit understanding that neither side along the tense Himalayan border should use firearms. Still, the deaths of more than 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops exposed the increasing aggressiveness of both countries, which are governed by nationalist leaders with little political incentive to back down.As many as 100,000 troops from the Indian and Chinese armies are now facing off across inhospitable mountain passes in subzero temperatures in the Ladakh region alone, military experts estimate.Since the summer, both sides have tried to ease tensions. But in India, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is contending with reports that China is far from done encroaching on disputed borderlands.This month, NDTV, an Indian news channel, revealed that China had created a new village on territory that India claims in another mountainous border state, Arunachal Pradesh. Satellite imagery shows neat rows of dozens of new homes that have been built on what had been an empty hillside two years ago.The NDTV report of new structures built in the harsh mountainous area is difficult to independently verify. Two Indian government officials in Arunachal said the Chinese had recently built villages in disputed areas along the border in places that used to have just a few remote military posts.“Where the army had been living, some civilians also started living there,” said D.J. Borah, a senior district official based in that area.When asked about the new village, officials at the Indian Foreign Ministry referred back to a statement given to NDTV in which the ministry said that it was aware of the recent report and that “China has undertaken such infrastructure construction activity in the past several years.”Leaders of India’s main opposition party have criticized Mr. Modi for staying silent on the matter. “China is expanding its occupation into Indian territory,” Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the party, Indian National Congress, said on Twitter.Chinese officials don’t deny that there are new villages in the area. But they say that area is in China.“China’s normal construction on its own territory is entirely a matter of sovereignty,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Minister, said this month.Local leaders in Arunachal Pradesh interviewed by The New York Times said the Chinese forces have been slowly but steadily cutting away small pieces of Indian territory, much like the strategy China has shown in the South China Sea and along its border with Bhutan. Military analysts call this salami slicing.“Longju used to be our land,” said Chatung Mra, a bank manager, using the local name for the general area where the Chinese village now stands. “Our forefathers used to live there.”The war in Ukraine. China’s officials and its media are increasingly repeating the Kremlin’s narrative about the conflict. This joint propaganda has undercut Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and has found a receptive audience in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.Relations with Europe. Chinese leaders have often viewed Europe as the softer wing of the Western world, unable and unwilling to contest China’s rise. But as the continent reassesses its security needs, that may change — and lead to a more antagonistic stance.A strict Covid policy. As China grapples with its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic, the government is following a “zero Covid” strategy. The approach has put hundreds of millions of people’s lives on pause and could have far-reaching effects.A pause on wealth redistribution. For much of last year, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, waged a fierce campaign to narrow social inequalities and usher in a new era of “common prosperity.” Now, as the economic outlook is increasingly clouded, the Communist Party is putting its campaign on the back burner.“We feel very bad but what can we do?” Mr. Mra asked. “We can’t fight them.”The area in question is in the foothills of the Himalayas and more than 1,500 miles from New Delhi, the capital. Official Indian maps showed that the Longju area lies several miles inside India, said the local leaders who have visited near the disputed area. But China, they said, has effectively controlled it since 1959.In recent years, they said, China has engaged in a flurry of construction projects along the border and rendered areas that used to be accessible to people on the Indian side now inaccessible.The Chinese infrastructure campaign, the local leaders said, far outpaced what India has been doing and has been effective in absorbing disputed areas into China.“Our place used to be up to five or six kilometers beyond Longju,” said Tungpo Mra, a leader of the Mra, a local ethnic group. “Now all that is in China’s control.”Taro Bamina, the general secretary of an Arunachal youth group, was especially frustrated and helped organize a protest last week that included hundreds of demonstrators in Daporijo, an Arunachal market town.“This is our motherland,” Mr. Bamina said. “We wanted to tell the government of India. ‘Why didn’t you take care of that?’’’What local leaders are reporting in Arunachal is similar to what local leaders in Ladakh have reported more than 2,000 miles away. In the past few years, according to Ladakh leaders, China has stepped up construction projects along the frontier with India, which zigs and zags through high mountain passes and has never been marked. The result is that China can move troops — and civilians — to the borderlands much faster than India.Chinese and Indian military commanders continue to hold talks along the disputed border in the Ladakh region. In the meantime, Ladakhi herders have complained that they have had to chase away Chinese vehicles that brazenly crossed into India.Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi and an Indian Army veteran, said the latest clash in Sikkim, an area where India had expected to have a strategic advantage because it has more troops, suggested that tensions would rise as the ground thaws.“If you see it in light of everything going on,” Mr. Singh said, “it means that, the coming summer, we are looking at a very tense situation.”Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.</body>

	<title>Trump’s ‘1776 report’ defends America’s founding on the basis of slavery and blasts progressivism.</title>
	<author>Michael Crowley</author>
	<body>The Trump White House on Monday released the report of the presidential “1776 Commission,” a sweeping attack on liberal thought and activism that calls for a “patriotic education,” defends America’s founding on the basis of slavery and likens progressivism to fascism.President Trump formed the commission in September, saying that American heritage was under assault by revolutionary fanatics and that the nation’s schools required a new “pro-American” curriculum.Its report, released on Martin Luther King’s Birthday, denounces the charge that the American founders were hypocrites who preached equality even as they codified slavery in the Constitution and held slaves themselves. “This charge is untrue, and has done enormous damage, especially in recent years, with a devastating effect on our civic unity and social fabric,” it says.The report argues that “distorted histories” of the United States “labor under the illusion that slavery was somehow a uniquely American evil,” and that the institution must “be seen in a much broader perspective,” including “the unfortunate fact” that slavery “has been more the rule than the exception throughout human history.”“Historical revisionism that tramples honest scholarship and historical truth, shames Americans by highlighting only the sins of their ancestors, and teaches claims of systemic racism that can only be eliminated by more discrimination, is an ideology intended to manipulate opinions more than educate minds,” the report says.The report is the product of the 18-member commission, which is chaired by Larry Arnn, a Trump ally and president of the conservative Hillsdale College. Other members include Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, and Mr. Trump’s former domestic policy adviser, Brooke Rollins.The document asserts that the civil rights movement evolved into “identity politics,” which it said “teaches that America itself is to blame for oppression.”It also said that progressives had created a “fourth branch of government” or “shadow government” which operates with no checks or balances, and likened American liberals to the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, who it said “sought to centralize power under the management of so-called experts.”The commission and its report are in part a rebuke to The New York Times Magazine’s 1619 Project, which reframes American history around the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans. The report denounces the project, as did Mr. Trump in his September speech announcing the commission.</body>

	<title>Trump Administration Quietly Eased Sanctions on Israeli Billionaire</title>
	<author>Eric Lipton</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration quietly moved in its final days to ease sanctions imposed in late 2017 on an Israeli billionaire who had been punished by the Treasury Department for corrupt and abusive mining practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The reversal by the Treasury came after an appeal by lobbyists with close ties to former President Donald J. Trump who were hired by Dan Gertler, the Israeli billionaire, including the lawyer Alan M. Dershowitz, who helped represent Mr. Trump during his first impeachment, and Louis J. Freeh, a former F.B.I. director.Mr. Gertler was accused in 2017 by the Trump-era Treasury Department of using his connections to the former Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, to arrange “opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals” that cost the citizens of Congo more than a billion dollars in lost revenue.The reversal by the Treasury drew immediate condemnation by human rights advocates, who said they hoped that the Biden administration would move to reverse the action.“Letting Dan Gertler off the hook sends a message to the world’s most corrupt businesspeople that the U.S. will let them walk free after a bit of lobbying,” said Sasha Lezhnev, the deputy director of policy at The Sentry, a nonprofit group that tracks African war criminals and foreigners who try to profit off them.Calvin Mitchell, a spokesman for Janet L. Yellen, who could be confirmed as soon as Monday as Treasury secretary, said the department was aware of the move but declined to comment when asked if the agency would reconsider.The license that the Treasury issued on Jan. 15 effectively gives Mr. Gertler, who is based in Israel, a year to do business with United States banks and other companies, while federal officials evaluate if they will more formally remove the sanctions. As part of the agreement, Mr. Gertler will hire outside monitors to confirm that he is now honoring standards set by the United States.The license also unblocks funds of Mr. Gertler’s that have been held in financial institutions based in the United States, including Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo.Sanctions were first placed on Mr. Gertler in December 2017 under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a law passed in 2016 that allows the United States to impose sanctions on foreign business executives or foreign government officials implicated in “gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.”Mr. Gertler was found to have used his friendship with Mr. Kabila to act as a middleman for mining sales in Congo, requiring other companies to go through Mr. Gertler to do business with the Congolese state, costing the country more than $1.36 billion in revenue, the Treasury Department said in 2017.“Gertler is an international businessman and billionaire who has amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” the Treasury Department said in 2018, as it expanded the sanctions against him.The application to issue a new license that allows United States companies to do business with Mr. Gertler was handled by the law firm Arnold &amp; Porter. Baruch Weiss, a lawyer at the firm who handled the matter, declined to comment Sunday, as did Mr. Dershowitz.Mr. Gertler as of October 2018 had hired Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Freeh, as well as Gregory A. Paw, a former federal prosecutor, to work on the matter, with the team then targeting the Treasury and State Departments to try to get the changes made, lobbying disclosure reports show. Also registered to lobby on the matter is Gary Apfel, a lawyer who like Mr. Dershowitz was involved in several successful pardon appeals to Mr. Trump in recent months.Erich C. Ferrari, a lawyer who represents U.S. and foreign companies on sanctions issues, reviewed the license that the Treasury issued on Jan. 15 and said he was surprised at how broadly it appeared to allow United States companies to work with Mr. Gertler, despite the sanctions in 2017 and 2018.“As hard as it is for me to believe that a license this broad was issued and exists, I have to say that it is indeed a license authorizing Gertler and companies owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, to engage in business with and through U.S. banks,” Mr. Ferrari said.The Sentry recommended in a statement Sunday that the United States banks not unblock Mr. Gertler’s money or “open accounts or otherwise conduct transactions for or on behalf of Gertler and his network until this matter is fully investigated and resolved.”Kenneth P.

	<title>An Inaugural Lockdown Comes at a Price for Washingtonians</title>
	<author>Matthew Rosenberg</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Chuck Weathers was waiting Monday morning on a bus in Columbia Heights, a residential neighborhood of shops and quaint homes about four miles north of the Capitol.It was cold, the bus was nowhere in sight and Mr. Weathers was annoyed.“We didn’t do a damn thing,” he said, referring to the people of Washington. “But now it’s our problem.”The problem he was confronting was the simple act of moving around the nation’s capital, which seemed to be getting increasingly difficult as the city shored itself up against potential violence for the inauguration on Wednesday of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Thousands of troops have poured into the capital, where armored military trucks are parked in the middle of streets to block traffic and subway stations and roads are closed.Downtown Washington is locked down, boarded up and on guard for the ushering in of the new leader in hopes of preventing a scene like the one that played out to the nation’s horror on Jan. 6 as a mob stormed the Capitol.The tight security has left Washington anxious, as rumors spread about threats of attacks by domestic terrorists looking to upset the transfer of power from President Trump to Mr. Biden. At one point on Monday, an inauguration rehearsal was postponed and the Capitol was briefly locked down over what turned out to be a fire in a nearby homeless encampment.All of this turmoil has picked away at wounds not close to being healed over from a summer of racial justice protests and the damage done by some in the crowds.Mr. Weathers, 56, had planned to spend the Martin Luther King holiday on Monday with a few friends. But they lived on the other side of the city.“The Metro trains are all screwed up,” he said. “I don’t know when a bus is coming.”What’s worse, Mr. Weathers, who works in a restaurant downtown, had no idea how he was going to get to work Tuesday. “I guess I’ll have to walk,” he said, adding a string of expletives about the rioters who attacked the Capitol.“They were all talking about ‘the people,’” he said. “What people? We people didn’t get anything out of what they did. Just trouble, making it difficult. For what?”Dog walkers, bikers and people out for a stroll have been caught up in a surreal, fortified corn maze of ever-changing metal security barriers across sidewalks and roadways that seem to be open one minute and closed the next.Cranky workers have bunched up at new checkpoints set up along the perimeter of the National Mall, worried they will be late for jobs. Stressed members of the Secret Service and other security forces sighed into their walkie-talkies, trying to keep up with frequent updates to security protocols. Checkpoints opened and closed. A hotel bellhop pushing a tall luggage cart was stymied by a concrete barrier, his guests lugging suitcases waiting just on the other side.A frustrated biker on Sunday approached a Metropolitan Police officer at a typically busy downtown intersection near the Mall.“Officer, how do I get out of this war zone?” he said, using a four-letter word.The man pointed south, toward an enormous wall of black fencing that blocked the street. “I live right down there,” he said, before being directed by an officer who seemed only somewhat sure of an open route.On Sunday afternoon, the streets were empty, the temperature was dropping and Wendell McCollough could not figure out how to enter the JW Marriott.The hotel, on the north side of Washington’s Freedom Plaza, was ordinarily a popular spot for tourists and visiting foreign officials. But now it was in a warren of steel fencing, concrete barriers and checkpoints, and its usual entrance was blocked off.“How do I get into this damned place?” he said as he trudged his suitcase around a corner, looking for a way to the lobby.Mr. McCollough, 50, of Terre Haute, Ind., was visiting his brother in Maryland and had decided to come to Washington for a few nights to see friends. He knew the city was going to be heavily guarded but, he said, “I didn’t think it would be crazy.”Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.No matter, he said. He was planning to stay a few days. The streets around his hotel were blocked off and empty. There were no cars. The only civilians appeared to be journalists and a few homeless men camped on the sidewalk next to the hotel.Tricia Ortiz, 48, who was walking her dog with a friend Sunday, had come downtown to see what all the fuss was about. Ms. Ortiz is an Army veteran, and one of her last assignments before retiring was to work on the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.Back then, “I learned very quickly that it was an exciting time to be in D.C.,” she said.“This is not it. There’s not going to be any crowds — not like the kind of crowds we’d have usually. This makes me feel like we’re at war,” Ms. Ortiz said.Businesses in downtown Washington, already hammered by the pandemic and civil unrest, in the past several days have been drained of even what had become a new, subdued normal. Near Farragut Square over the weekend, a woman sat alone at a folding table piled with Trump-themed hats and winter accessories. Hardly any customers had materialized, she said.The woman, who asked not to be named because of a permit issue for street vending, said the vibe was different from Jan. 5 and 6, when large crowds provided lots of business.“It’s because of what happened in the Capitol,” she said, glancing at the empty street behind her.Many buildings had facades of plywood. Restaurants, hotels and coffee outlets all were shuttered or had notices taped to their entrances about plans to close for the rest of the week.In place of the normal ebb and flow were soldiers with assault rifles or with handguns strapped to their legs spaced out across multiple intersections. The troops have become sounding boards for some citizens.On Monday morning Camille Johnson, 54, who immigrated three decades ago from Uganda, stood before a line of soldiers pouring out his heart about the state of America.Uganda’s president of 35 years, Yoweri Museveni, had just been re-elected amid accusations of vote rigging. U.S. election observers were in place there, an irony that Mr. Johnson could not shake.“We came from overseas. We know. Trump has all the signs of being a dictator,” said Mr. Johnson, an executive in the hotel industry. “It makes me sad Americans are not seeing where they are going.”Ali Watkins and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>China wanted to show off its vaccines. It’s backfiring.</title>
	<author>Sui-Lee Wee</author>
	<body>China’s coronavirus vaccines were supposed to deliver a geopolitical win that showcased the country’s scientific prowess and generosity. Instead, in some places, they have set off a backlash.Officials in Brazil and Turkey have complained that Chinese companies have been slow to ship the doses and ingredients. Disclosures about the Chinese vaccines have been spotty. The few announcements that have trickled out suggest that China’s vaccines, while considered effective, cannot stop the virus as well as those developed by Pfizer and Moderna, the American drugmakers.In the Philippines, some lawmakers have criticized the government’s decision to purchase a vaccine made by a Chinese company called Sinovac. Officials in Malaysia and Singapore, which ordered doses from Sinovac, have had to reassure their citizens that they would approve a vaccine only if it has been proven safe and effective.At least 24 countries, most of them low and middle income, signed deals with the Chinese vaccine companies because they offered access at a time when richer nations had claimed most of the doses made by Pfizer and Moderna. But the delays in getting the Chinese vaccines and the fact that the vaccines are less effective mean that those countries may take longer to vanquish the virus.Beijing officials who had hoped the vaccines would burnish China’s global reputation are now on the defensive. The state news media has started a misinformation campaign against the American vaccines and promoting the Chinese vaccines as a better alternative. They have also distributed online videos that have been shared by the anti-vaccine movement in the United States.The vaccines are also meant to prove that China has become a scientific and diplomatic powerhouse. It remains on par with the United States in the number of vaccines approved for emergency use or in late-stage trials. Sinopharm, a state-owned vaccine maker, and Sinovac have said they can produce up to a combined two billion doses this year, making them essential to the global fight against the coronavirus.Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, their doses can be kept at refrigerated temperatures and are more easily transported, making them appealing to the developing world.China’s campaign has been plagued with doubts, however. A YouGov survey this month of roughly 19,000 people in 17 countries and regions showed that most were distrustful of a Covid-19 vaccine made in China. The misinformation campaign surrounding Western vaccines could further undermine its image.</body>

	<title>Investors Push Home Depot and Omnicom to Steer Ads From Misinformation</title>
	<author>Marc Tracy</author>
	<body>Shareholders in Home Depot and the advertising giant Omnicom have filed resolutions asking the companies to investigate whether the money they spent on advertisements may have helped spread hate speech and misinformation.The resolutions were filed in November but were not made public until Monday. They were coordinated by Open MIC, a nonprofit group that works with shareholders at media and technology companies.The two shareholder resolutions, which used similar language, asked Home Depot and Omnicom to commission independent investigations into whether their advertising policies “contribute to the spread of hate speech, disinformation, white supremacist activity, or voter suppression efforts.”“Advertisers are not passive bystanders when they inadvertently finance harm,” the resolutions said. “Their spending influences what content appears online.”Omnicom manages $38 billion a year for its marketing clients, while Home Depot advertises heavily on Facebook, according to the filings.Misinformation about voter fraud, spread in large part through online platforms, contributed to a siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 by a mob fueled by debunked conspiracy theories about a stolen election — theories promoted by President Trump and his allies.These days, companies devote more than half their spending on global marketing to digital ads. Because many of those ads are placed by third-party vendors using automated algorithms, often with little human oversight, companies are frequently unaware when their ads show up on websites that peddle misinformation.A report last week by NewsGuard highlighted the problem. The company evaluates the trustworthiness of online news outlets, and was started by Steven Brill, the founder of the magazine The American Lawyer, and Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The report found that 1,668 brands ran 8,776 unique ads on 160 sites that published misinformation about the 2020 election.The outlets flagged by NewsGuard include The Gateway Pundit, Infowars, Newsmax and websites affiliated with the right-wing pundits Sean Hannity, Dan Bongino and Rush Limbaugh.Companies have struggled in recent years to reach potential customers while making sure their online ads do not appear close to dubious, salacious or potentially harmful content. AARP, which was mentioned in the NewsGuard report as one of the companies that had placed ads on sites promoting false election claims, said that, despite rigorous monitoring procedures, some ads slipped through the cracks.“We follow strict ad placement protocols, but no system is 100 percent foolproof,” Martha Boudreau, an AARP executive vice president, said in a statement.An AARP internal review found that “a tiny portion” of its ads, less than 1/100th of 1 percent, appeared on the sites flagged by NewsGuard, Ms. Boudreau added.Matt Skibinski, the general manager of NewsGuard, said companies should treat sites that publish misinformation the same way they treat sites that promote behaviors that do not align with their corporate values or that publish content they do not want to be associated with.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.“At many brands, there is somebody whose job it is to make sure they don’t place ads in what they would call unsafe or unsuitable environments, and that includes violence, pornography and gambling,” Mr. Skibinski said. “We need the industry to start seeing misinformation in that category — of creating real-world harm.”NewsGuard reported that Procter &amp; Gamble ads had appeared on The Gateway Pundit, one of the sites it called out for publishing election misinformation. In an email, Procter &amp; Gamble said it had not intentionally advertised on the site. Erica Noble, a Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman, said that when the company’s ads are placed on a site that does not meet its standards, it acts quickly to remove them.“These are all standards that were in place well before the horrific events of Jan. 6, but we appreciate they take on renewed importance now,” she said.Since the Capitol siege, social media platforms have cracked down. Facebook, which weathered an advertiser boycott during the summer over misinformation and hate speech, barred Mr. Trump from its platform and said it would remove content related to the “Stop the Steal” movement. Twitter took similar action.Omnicom said in a statement that it “is committed to ensuring our clients’ ads do not appear next to harmful content on social media platforms” and pointed to an effort it spearheaded in the summer to audit and track platforms’ ad placement practices.Home Depot said in a statement that it was “saddened and outraged by the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol and our lawmakers” and “disgusted” by malicious content on social media.“We’re addressing the proposal through the appropriate process,” said Sara Gorman, a spokeswoman.</body>

	<title>Mexico’s president is the latest world leader to become infected with the coronavirus.</title>
	<author>Oscar Lopez</author>
	<body>Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said Sunday that he had contracted the coronavirus and was undergoing “medical treatment” for what he described as mild symptoms.Mr. López Obrador, writing on Twitter, said he would continue to carry out his official duties, including holding a call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that is set for Monday.“As always, I am optimistic,” he said.The Mexican leader has consistently played down the pandemic, questioning the value of wearing masks and refusing to wear one himself in most public appearances.On Friday, he posted a photo of himself indoors, again without a mask, conducting a call with President Biden. He was accompanied by Marcelo Ebrard, the foreign minister, and Alfonso Romo, a former top aide — and neither was wearing a mask. And on Saturday, the president met with local business leaders in Monterrey.Hours before disclosing that he had contracted the virus, Mr. López Obrador, who flies commercial on all official trips, sat in coach on a flight from San Luis Potosí to Mexico City, according to local media reports.As late as June, Mr. López Obrador was still sounding dismissive. He said that having a clean conscience would help fight off the virus. “No lying, no stealing, no betraying, that helps a lot to not get coronavirus,” he told reporters.And for months, the president has repeatedly insisted that the end of the pandemic’s devastation was just around the corner.“The worst is ending,” he said this month, as deaths surged. “We are coming out of it.”In the spring, The New York Times reported that the Mexican government had failed to record hundreds, possibly thousands, of deaths in Mexico City, dismissing officials who had tallied more than three times as many fatalities in the capital than the government had publicly acknowledged.Then in December, federal officials, loath to damage the economy still further, reassured the public that Mexico City had not reached the level of contagion that would require a full lockdown. In fact, the government’s own numbers showed that the capital had surpassed that threshold, an analysis by The Times found.Some public health experts said they were little surprised that Mr. López Obrador had become infected, given his preference for going mask free, even in situations where the risk of exposure was high.“One even expected or assumed, because of his way of exposing himself to so many people and not wearing a mask, that he would have been infected earlier,” said Carlos Magis Rodríguez, professor of medicine at the National Autonomous University in Mexico. “In all the public appearances of López Obrador, except for when he went to visit Trump, we saw him without a face mask.”He said there was reason for concern about the prognosis for Mr. López Obrador, who is 67 and had a heart attack in 2013. “He’s at greater risk than a young person,” Dr. Magis said.Mr. López Obrador has told reporters that he will wait to get vaccinated with the rest of his age group, most likely in mid-March.The news came as Mexico is confronting its worst moment since the pandemic began, with deaths hitting horrific highs. On Thursday, Mexico confirmed 1,803 new coronavirus deaths, surging past the previous record of more than 1,500 set days earlier.And while the president is already being treated, many Mexicans are struggling to get medical care. The country’s hospitals are overrun, and close to 90 percent of beds in Mexico City, the epicenter of the national outbreak, are occupied.Mexico has intentionally kept testing low throughout the pandemic, which has obscured the true extent of the virus’s reach across the country. But it is undeniable that Mr. López Obrador has presided over one of the worst outbreaks in the world.To date, the country has recorded more than 1.7 million coronavirus infections and nearly 150,000 deaths, the fourth-highest global death toll.Official numbers severely underestimate the true toll of the pandemic. As of December, the country had recorded 250,000 more deaths than expected, an excess mortality rate that suggests the pandemic has been far deadlier than official numbers suggest.Kirk Semple and Elda Cantú contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>How to Fix 4 Years of Trump’s War Against Government</title>
	<author>Alexa Kissinger</author>
	<body>Of all the urgent tasks facing the Biden administration, among the most pressing is to unwind former President Donald Trump’s four-year effort to “deconstruct the administrative state.”From headline-grabbing policies like caging children at the southern border to stealth rollbacks of climate and environmental regulations, politicizing the role of science and leaving hundreds of key political appointments vacant during a pandemic, the consequences of the Trump administration’s governing philosophy will take swift, sustained and systemic efforts to mend.In the dwindling months of his presidency, Mr. Trump pushed through a series of so-called midnight rules, surreptitiously sliding politically controversial and unpopular legacy items under the wire.These recent rules, for example, would expand the methods of execution in federal death cases to include electrocution and death by firing squad. They broaden the definition of “independent contractors,” allowing gig economy companies to avoid providing benefits and safety protections to their workers. They prevent immigration judges from using their discretion to close immigration cases and halt deportations, and allow federal contractors to claim a religious exemption to discriminate in hiring. They shield companies from liability for killing migratory birds and effectively ban certain methods of scientific research in the drafting of public health rules.Although the practice has historically been deployed by presidents of both parties, Mr. Trump turned it into a sport, finalizing more rules in his last year than any other modern president and even bypassing statutory waiting periods. Between Election Day and Inauguration Day alone, the Trump administration issued 53 new rules.Faced with this catalog of harm, the new administration has wasted no time. Just hours after being sworn in, President Biden took bold action to freeze a litany of final and pending agency regulations and signed a bevy of executive orders reversing Trump-era policies.But the scope of the problem requires more aggressive action. The Biden administration should also use the Congressional Review Act to reverse even more of the recent rules. The wins in Georgia’s Senate races — giving Democrats control of both houses of Congress as the presidency changes hands — provide the rare opportunity to use this little-known law.The review act allows agency rules sent to Congress on Aug. 21, 2020, or later to be rescinded by bare-majority votes in both houses, with the approval of the president. The rejection of a rule further bars an agency from adopting one that is “substantially the same” in the future, making reversal more enduring than some actions the executive can take alone. To not use this tool as part of a comprehensive strategy to roll back a catalog of Trump administration regulations would be a missed opportunity.But even this quick action will be insufficient to repair four years of damage. Truly repairing the administrative state will require the more fundamental work of restoring our federal agencies and institutions. Mr. Trump entered Washington with a deep distrust of the over two million federal employees, and his preferred approach to personnel was to rearrange a shrinking cadre of loyal staff members.Over half of the senior positions at the Education, Justice and Homeland Security Departments simply went unfilled. Rather than sending senior nominations to the Senate, the administration recycled nearly 30 acting cabinet secretaries who served more than three times as many days as the acting secretaries of the Obama era. Morale among federal workers declined during Mr. Trump’s presidency, and career officials have given haunting accounts of their efforts to maintain democratic guardrails within agencies.The future success of the administrative state will require restoring the dignity of public service and the value of policymaking informed by the expertise of career employees. The Biden administration should continue to move quickly to nominate and confirm key positions with experts and experienced, innovative thinkers to rebuild a neglected bureaucracy. They will need to assemble a Justice Department that returns to the tradition of operating independently of the president, revive a hollowed-out State Department where cubicles have been empty for years and staff the government with individuals who want to fulfill its promise rather than throw sand in its gears.The Trump administration also waged a subterranean campaign against science. The Environmental Protection Agency is at its lowest staffing level in a decade, with scores of research projects stymied by the gutting of federal advisory boards and research committees. The response to the pandemic, which saw Trump administration officials sideline scientists and undermine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data and guidelines, made clear the peril of anti-science dogma. Reversing the damage will require reinstituting policymaking processes informed by the best available data, unclouded by political considerations.The animosity toward data has been particularly insidious in our intelligence agencies, where leaders have been publicly fired for following protocol and pressured to alter intelligence and its conclusions so as not to contradict the president’s public stances. For the sake of our national security, intelligence officials must be empowered to provide independent intelligence and encouraged to speak the truth, even when it proves politically inexpedient.Through rebuilding the objectivity of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, hiring expert ombudsmen and inspectors general, and restoring the integrity of intelligence, the Biden administration can push back against the politicization of analysis that has plagued recent decision-making. In her recent confirmation hearing, Avril Haines, the new director of national intelligence, vowed to release a long-withheld report on the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Embodying the Biden administration’s fundamental shift in approach, she said simply, “We will follow the law.”We are only just beginning to understand the extent to which the past four years have corroded our federal institutions. But they haven’t changed forever. With quick action in the first 100 days and a sustained commitment to science, intelligence and the very notion of service, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris can rebuild a fortified “administrative state” equipped for the 21st century.Neil Eggleston is an attorney who served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2017.

	<title>‘I Let You Down’: Klete Keller’s Path From Olympics to Capitol Riot</title>
	<author>Karen Crouse</author>
	<body>The swimming coach did not know what to expect when he dialed Klete Keller’s phone number.An explanation of why Keller, an Olympic gold medalist, had been in the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol a week earlier? A defense of his actions, which have left him facing criminal charges? Denial? Rationalizing? Rage?The last thing he expected was for Keller, the decorated swimmer he had known as a merry prankster, to dissolve into tears.“He apologized to me,” Mark Schubert, who once trained Keller at the University of Southern California, said in recounting their conversation after Keller’s arrest last week. “He kept repeating, ‘You’ve done so much for me, and I let you down.’ He kept saying over and over, ‘I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.’”Of the dozens of people now facing charges and possible prison sentences for invading the Capitol, only a handful have drawn more attention than Klete Keller, a three-time Olympian who won two gold medals as a relay teammate of Michael Phelps.Yet within days after he was spotted in videos of the pro-Trump crowds that assaulted the Capitol, friends and former teammates of Keller, 38, turned him in to the F.B.I. Strangers demanded that he go to prison. And prominent voices called for him to be stripped of his Olympic medals.Keller, through his lawyer, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., declined to be interviewed.To those who know Keller best, it was nothing less than bizarre to see a man who had once stood atop an Olympic medals podium with his hand over his heart during the national anthem — the personification, in that moment, of American greatness and success — acting as a part of a mob bent on disrupting the United States’ democracy. But they could not say they were surprised.In addition to his successes, they also knew of his professional setbacks and the slow personal unraveling that had followed his triumphs. They were aware of his struggles to settle into a career; of his divorce; of the child custody dispute that had separated him from his three young children; and of a dark period in which he spent nearly a year living out of his car.They also knew his politics. Keller, who lives in Colorado, had telegraphed his allegiance to President Trump on his now-deleted social media accounts for much of the past year, they said. In November, he traveled to Washington to attend an election protest and pro-Trump rally labeled the Million MAGA March. Keller had marked the day with a Facebook post in which he posed in Washington’s streets, quoted the conservative firebrand Sebastian Gorka and railed about “this brazen assault on our republic and our way of life.”Still, after his name began to show up in newspaper headlines and television news broadcasts, a few of those closest to Keller chose to see a glimmer of hope in his easy identification. If he had gone to the Capitol with mayhem on his mind, they told themselves, he surely wouldn’t have shown up unmasked and wearing his U.S. Olympic team jacket.During a swimming career that carried him to three Olympics and five Olympic medals, the 6-foot-6 Keller was known for his affability. A towering man, he had a foghorn laugh that cut through the tedium and tension of high-pressure athletics. He lived to be liked, his former teammates said, and on the national teams he was known as a champion prankster, pulling off a memorable stunt at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. After catching one of the big, loud beetles squatting in the athletes’ village dormitories, he placed it at the bottom of a giant tub of pretzels in the U.S. team room, then maintained a straight face until someone finishing the snacks shrieked upon snatching the beetle, sending half the team sprinting for the door.While none of those interviewed condoned Keller’s appearance at the Capitol — he faces federal charges of being in a restricted building, disorderly conduct and obstructing law enforcement — his acquaintances recalled a melancholy side to him, a sense that he was going through the motions of swimming rather than reveling in the sport.Dave Salo, who coached Keller in the lead-up to the 2008 Olympics, said he had a hard time squaring the swimmer he knew, whom he described as “nonconfrontational, quiet, relatively passive,” with someone who would twice travel across the country to participate in protests about the 2020 election.“I was surprised that he would find the internal motivation to hike out to D.C.,” Salo said.In a sport known for its rigor and discipline, others remembered, Keller could fall out of shape almost as fast as he could swim — packing on pounds after a competition like an actor preparing for a sedentary role, only to shrink back to racing shape as another Olympics beckoned.So effortlessly did Keller glide along life’s surface that for a long time few people had any inkling of his personal struggles away from the pool. In the months before the 2004 Athens Olympics, for example, Keller endured a stretch of sleeplessness and malaise that culminated in what his coach at the time, Jon Urbanchek, described as an “emotional breakdown.”Keller rebounded to deliver one of the signature moments of those Games, holding off the Australian star Ian Thorpe over the final 100 meters of their anchor legs to clinch the gold for the United States in the 4x200 freestyle relay. It was his second medal of the Olympics, and the fourth of five he would eventually claim in his decorated international career.He later admitted it was a mistake to stick with swimming after his star turn in Greece. In a 2014 interview with NBC Sports, Keller said he regretted that he had not retired after Athens. Around this time, he told a different interviewer, he had entertained the idea of enrolling at Arizona State to study criminology. But unsure of his path, Keller chose to stay with what he knew.“It’s not right, but I still probably hold some bitterness toward myself mostly, but also a little bit toward my sport, because I let myself get too deep into it,” Keller said at the time.After earning a third freestyle relay medal — his second gold — at the 2008 Beijing Games, Keller walked away for good. Having finally earned his bachelor’s degree, he married and started a family. Once again, at least outwardly, he appeared to be moving forward with ease.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.But jobs in finance and sales didn’t pan out. His marriage fell apart, and a contentious divorce kept him from seeing his young daughter and two sons for long periods. Unemployed and homeless, he spent months living out of his Ford Fusion, he said in an interview with U.S.A. Swimming’s website in 2018. He kept up his gym membership, he said, only so he would have a place to shower.“Great person, great soul, great teammate,” said Tom Malchow, a teammate of Keller’s at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics. “But he just had a hard time finding his place in society outside the pool.”For Keller, swimming had been an elixir that left an unpleasant aftertaste. In retirement, he spoke of how his singular focus on sports had left no room for planning his post-pool life. He acknowledged struggling with the transition, and especially with his expectations that he reach the same heights in whatever new career he chose.Still, by 2018, he suggested he had turned a corner. He was working in a job selling real estate in Colorado Springs. He was spending time with his children again.“I feel like I’ve come through the darkness and found the light that I always wanted and needed to be happy,” he said in the U.S.A. Swimming interview in which he detailed what had been, to that point, his nadir. “I’m getting there.”Even his closest confidants said they were unclear how Keller had been drawn into politics, though several said his activism seemed to have gathered force over the past year. In a politically polarized era, friends with different leanings took a position that would feel familiar to people in millions of American families: Instead of asking Keller about his pro-Trump social media posts, they simply steered clear of the subject.There no longer can be any sidestepping his allegiances. Last Tuesday, six days after the Capitol riot, Keller lost his job. On Wednesday, he was charged with three federal crimes, including obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.On Thursday, the day Keller was taken into custody in Colorado and then released after a brief appearance in court, he spoke to Urbanchek, the coach he had once described in U.S.A. Swimming’s media guide as “the type of man I want to be.”Urbanchek said Keller cried throughout their 15-minute conversation. He was upset with himself, Urbanchek said, and told his old coach that “he never thought about what could happen.”Urbanchek added, “He was at the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong people.”It was a lifetime away from the Olympic Aquatic Centre in Athens on Aug. 17, 2004, when Keller was in the right place at the right time with the right people, swimming the final leg of a relay after Phelps, Ryan Lochte and Peter Vanderkaay, and touching the wall first to win the gold.“I was just thinking of all my teammates cheering me on and on the sideline,” he told reporters of his performance. “I wanted to make them proud. Make my country proud.”</body>

	<title>Avoiding the Obama-Era Silence Trap</title>
	<author>Charles M. Blow</author>
	<body>I remember the Obama years well. There was a massive surge of national pride when Barack Obama was elected. America had done something important. It had overcome a hurdle on its path to racial inclusion. It had dealt a blow to its past.That was the feeling. But it was just a feeling.After a brief honeymoon period, the real work of governing set in and the opposition rallied. At times the vitriol coming at not only Obama, but at his family, was so beyond the pale that the natural impulse among many liberals was to circle the wagons around him.Progressives felt it necessary to clip their own wings, to temper their demands and be restrained in their complaints, lest their fair critique become conflated with the unfair attacks of those opposed to any progressive achievements.Leaning in could easily come to feel like piling on. There was a whisper in the air, an unspoken insistence, that the role of the left was to uplift a Democratic president rather than to task him.But this is the presidency. The job is synonymous with pressure. No one who is unequipped to deal with pressure — including pressure from people who helped them get elected — should seek it.I remember my own writings in the early days of Obama’s presidency. I thought it fair. Much of it was praise and defense of him.Conservatives would often respond positively to the criticism in my columns, even while making sure that I understood that they disagreed with me on almost everything else. They would say things like, “You’re finally beginning to open your eyes” or, “You’re coming off the Democratic plantation.”Liberals, particularly other Black people, often took my criticisms as traitorous. I was called self-hating, an Uncle Tom and a “handkerchief head,” a pejorative for a Black person submissive to white people.I felt that I was simply doing my job to call things as I saw them and to stand up for a set of values, liberal and progressive. But there was a brisk market at the time for Black people willing to criticize Obama. They could say things about him that would be considered racist, or racially insensitive, if coming from a white person.I saw many Black people give in to the attraction of this check. It was a hustle.Trying to not be grouped into that cohort became a task unto itself. Learning to turn down some TV appearances from producers who only called after my column had included a critique of the president, but never after it had praised him.But, this burden of subconsciously modulating responses and demands of a presidency and administration is unfair to liberals and does real harm to liberalism itself.For progressives to refrain from applying pressure is to abdicate responsibility, because it allows an unnatural imbalance in which the only pressure the president feels is from his staunchest opponents.With the beginning of the Joe Biden administration, I sincerely hope that liberals have learned this lesson, and I believe that many have.As Clayola Brown, president of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, told The Washington Post, it is important “not to do what we did with Barack Obama, which is sit back and think now we have it fixed. It’s not fixed. Or to sit back and think that the work has been done. It’s only started.”We understand that Biden takes office during a time of multiple, major crises facing the country and that he will have to clean up behind a destructive and disastrous Trump administration.But progress must be made on the issues that progressives care about. When Republicans held power they wielded it without regret and even tried to enshrine it. Now, they would like nothing more than to guilt and scare Democrats into not aggressively pursuing a transformative agenda, hoping to contain them to middling changes as they wait for the time the political winds once again shift in their direction, and they surely will shift.Democratic politicians too often live under the illusion that if they moderate their aspirations and asks, they can appease the mushy middle of the electorate, often white, that sees no problem or contradiction in voting for Obama one election, Trump the next and Biden the next.They chase the fickle at the expense of the fervent.Progressives simply can’t afford to let that happen again.It is not apostasy to demand results from your leaders, elected by your support, on the issues that you care about. Nor is it apostasy to call them out if they are too eager to compromise away any real chance at substantive change.Republicans are going to resist and obstruct at every turn. That is their strategy. The question is: What are Democrats going to do? What is their strategy?They must be unflinching and bold, insistent of aggressive policy change, and the media and the public — especially those who helped elect them — must be similarly unflinching in their reproval.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>How Space Became the Next ‘Great Power’ Contest Between the U.S. and China</title>
	<author>William J. Broad</author>
	<body>Beijing’s rush for antisatellite arms began 15 years ago. Now, it can threaten the orbital fleets that give the United States military its technological edge. Advanced weapons at China’s military bases can fire warheads that smash satellites and can shoot laser beams that have a potential to blind arrays of delicate sensors.And China’s cyberattacks can, at least in theory, cut off the Pentagon from contact with fleets of satellites that track enemy movements, relay communications among troops and provide information for the precise targeting of smart weapons.Among the most important national security issues now facing President Biden is how to contend with the threat that China poses to the American military in space and, by extension, terrestrial forces that rely on the overhead platforms.The Biden administration has yet to indicate what it plans to do with President Donald J. Trump’s legacy in this area: the Space Force, a new branch of the military that has been criticized as an expensive and ill-advised escalation that could lead to a dangerous new arms race.Mr. Trump presented the initiative as his own, and it now suffers from an association with him and remains the brunt of jokes on television. But its creation was also the culmination of strategic choices by his predecessors, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, to counter an emboldened China that raised bipartisan alarm.“There’s been a dawning realization that our space systems are quite vulnerable,” said Greg Grant, a Pentagon official in the Obama administration who helped devise its response to China. “The Biden administration will see more funding — not less — going into space defense and dealing with these threats.”The protective goal is to create an American presence in orbit so resilient that, no matter how deadly the attacks, it will function well enough for the military to project power halfway around the globe in terrestrial reprisals and counterattacks. That could deter Beijing’s strikes in the first place. The hard question is how to achieve that kind of strong deterrence.Lloyd J. Austin III, a retired four-star Army general who was confirmed last week as Mr. Biden’s secretary of defense, told the Senate that he would keep a “laserlike focus” on sharpening the country’s “competitive edge” against China’s increasingly powerful military. Among other things, he called for new American strides in building “space-based platforms” and repeatedly referred to space as a war-fighting domain.“Space is already an arena of great power competition,” Mr. Austin said, with China “the most significant threat going forward.”The new administration has shown interest in tapping the innovations of space entrepreneurs as a means of strengthening the military’s hand — what Mr. Austin in his Senate testimony called “partnerships with commercial space entities.” The Obama and Trump administrations both adopted that strategy as a uniquely American way of sharpening the military’s edge.Experts clash on whether the United States is doing too little or too much. Defense hawks had lobbied for decades for the creation of a military Space Corps and called for more spending on weapons.But arms controllers see the Space Force as raising global tensions and giving Beijing an excuse to accelerate its own threatening measures. Some go further and call it a precipitous move that will increase the likelihood of war.In decades past, especially during the “Star Wars” program of the Reagan administration, conflict in space was often portrayed as shootouts in orbit. That has changed. With few exceptions, the weapons are no longer seen as circling the planet but as being deployed from secure bases. So, too, the targets are no longer swarms of nuclear warheads but fleets of satellites, whose recurring, predictable paths while orbiting the Earth make them far easier to destroy.A main question is whether the antisatellite moves and countermoves will lower or raise the risks of miscalculation and war. That debate is just beginning.For years, the Chinese studied — with growing anxiety — the American military, especially its invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The battlefield successes were seen as rooted in space dominance. Planners noted that thousands of satellite-guided bombs and cruise missiles had rained down with devastating precision on Taliban forces and Iraqi defenses.While the Pentagon’s edge in orbital assets was clearly a threat to China, planners argued that it might also represent a liability.“They saw how the U.S. projected power,” said Todd Harrison, a space analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “And they saw that it was largely undefended.”China began its antisatellite tests in 2005. It fired two missiles in two years and then made headlines in 2007 by shattering a derelict weather satellite. There was no explosion. The inert warhead simply smashed into the satellite at blinding speed. The successful test reverberated globally because it was the first such act of destruction since the Cold War.The whirling shards, more than 150,000 in all, threatened satellites as well as the International Space Station. Ground controllers raced to move dozens of spacecraft and astronauts out of harm’s way.The Bush administration initially did little. Then, in a show of force meant to send Beijing a message, in 2008, it fired a sophisticated missile to shoot down one of its own satellites.Beijing conducted about a dozen more tests, including ones in which warheads shot much higher, in theory putting most classes of American spacecraft at risk.China also sought to diversify its antisatellite force. A warhead could take hours to reach a high orbit, potentially giving American forces time for evasive or retaliatory action. Moreover, the speeding debris from a successful attack might endanger Beijing’s own spacecraft.In tests, China began firing weak laser beams at satellites and studying other ways to strike at the speed of light. However, all the techniques were judged as requiring years and perhaps decades of development.Then came the new idea. Every aspect of American space power was controlled from the ground by powerful computers. If penetrated, the brains of Washington’s space fleets might be degraded or destroyed. Such attacks, compared with every other antisatellite move, were also remarkably inexpensive.In 2005, China began to incorporate cyberattacks into its military exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks. Increasingly, its military doctrine called for paralyzing early attacks.In 2008, hackers seized control of a civilian imaging satellite named Terra that orbited low, like the military’s reconnaissance craft. They did so twice — first in June and again in October — roaming control circuits with seeming impunity. Remarkably, in both cases, the hackers achieved all the necessary steps to command the spacecraft but refrained from doing so, apparently to reduce their fingerprints.Space officials were troubled by more than China’s moves and weapons. The modern history of the American military centered on building global alliances. Beijing was rushing ahead as an aggressive loner, and many officers feared that Washington was too hidebound and burdened with the responsibilities of coalition-building and arms-control treaties to react quickly.“The Chinese are starting from scratch,” Paul S. Szymanski, a veteran analyst of space warfare, argued in an Air Force journal. They’re not, he added, “hindered by long space traditions.”In its second term, the Obama administration made public what it called an “offset strategy” to respond to China and other threats by capitalizing on America’s technological edge.Just as the United States had developed, first, a vast nuclear arsenal and, second, smart weapons, this so-called third offset would seek an advantage by speeding the rise of robotics, high-speed arms and other breakthroughs that could empower the armed forces for decades. Unlike earlier offsets, officials said, the objective was to rely less on federal teams than the tech entrepreneurs who were fast transforming the civilian world.“We must really capture the commercial sector,” Robert O. Work, a deputy secretary of defense, said in a 2015 speech explaining the new initiative.The advances in space were to be defensive: swarms of small, relatively cheap satellites and fleets of recycled launchers that would overwhelm Beijing with countless targets. For Mr. Obama, innovative leaps were to do for American space forces what Steve Jobs did for terrestrial gadgets, running circles around the calcified ministries of authoritarian states.After decades in which adversaries — from stateless terrorists to those with traditional militaries — sought to exploit narrow advantages over the more powerful United States, the Pentagon was now finding an unconventional edge all its own.The Obama administration was already applying the commercial philosophy to NASA, turning the space agency into a major funder of entrepreneurial strides. It was pumping billions of dollars into the development of private rockets and capsules meant to carry astronauts into orbit.The military joined in. The beneficiaries included Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Their space companies — Mr. Musk’s SpaceX and Mr. Bezos’s Blue Origin — sought to turn rocket launchers from throwaways into recyclables, slashing their cost.Military officials believed that the new system would make it possible to quickly replace satellites in times of war. The third offset also sought to shrink the size of satellites. Over decades, the big ones had grown into behemoths. Some cost $1 billion or more to design, construct, outfit, launch and keep in service. One type unfurled an antenna nearly as large as a football field. But civilians, inspired by the iPhone revolution, were building spacecraft as small as loaves of bread.Military planners saw smaller, cheaper, more numerous craft as making antisatellite targeting vastly more difficult — in some cases impossible — for an adversary.The initiative aided companies such as Planet Labs, which sought to build hundreds of tiny Earth-observing satellites, and Capella Space, which designed small radar-imaging satellites meant to see through clouds. It also bolstered SpaceX, where Mr. Musk envisioned a fleet of thousands of communication satellites.The administration, increasingly worried about Beijing’s strides, also raised its spending on offensive space control — without saying exactly what that meant.Federal investment in the tech entrepreneurs totaled $7.2 billion, most of it during the Obama years, according to a NASA report. It said the funds went to 67 companies. The approach differed from the usual Pentagon method, which dictated terms to contractors. Instead, the private sector led the way. As predicted, the small investments made a big difference.By the end of the Obama administration, SpaceX was firing payloads into space and successfully returning booster rockets to Earth in soft landings.Mr. Obama tweeted his congratulations in April 2016 when, for the first time, a SpaceX booster landed successfully on a platform at sea.Two years later, Mr. Trump unveiled the Space Force, prompting jokes on Twitter and late-night television and even a Netflix sitcom. But in March, the unit said it had taken possession of its first offensive weapon, calling the event historic. Based on land, the system fires energy beams to disrupt spacecraft. Lt. Col. Steve Brogan, a space combat specialist, said the acquisition “puts the ‘force’ in Space Force and is critical for space as a war-fighting domain.”The Trump administration last year asked Congress for a start on what it called counter-space weapons, putting their expected cost at many hundreds of millions of dollars. The military’s classified budget for the offensive abilities is said to run much higher. In word and deed, the administration also backed new reliance on the swarms of commercial strides.Trump officials described their steps as a response not only to Beijing’s progress but its plans. In 2019, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency warned that China appeared to be deploying a new generation of extremely powerful lasers that could flash to life by the middle of this decade, putting new classes of American satellites at risk.Analysts say the Biden administration might keep the Space Force, which has bipartisan support in Congress. Military experts see its high profile as sending Beijing a clear message.“You have to have an organizational constituency,” said James E. Cartwright, a retired Marine Corps general and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2007 to 2011. “That’s starting to happen. You’ve got a new emphasis on space — on people who get up every day thinking about how to manage these threats.”The stars of the current space age include not only famous entrepreneurs but a new generation of unknown dreamers and doers.Developing states, small companies and even high schools are now lofting spacecraft into orbit. New Zealand hosts a spaceport. Turkey and Peru have their own spy satellites. Tiny Luxembourg runs more satellites than Spain, Italy or Germany. India in 2019 fired an antisatellite weapon into orbit. Last year, Iran launched its first military satellite.The United States leads in satellite tallies, mainly because of its space-age legacies and its many entrepreneurs, including those now aiding the military. The Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, Mass., currently lists 1,425 for the United States, 382 for China and 172 for Russia.But China is pushing hard. For three years in a row, it has fired more rockets into space than any other country. It is now a dominating force, analysts say. The rush includes not only antisatellite weapons but many other military and scientific projects, as suggested by its recent retrieval of moon rocks.In June, Chinese scientists reported new progress in using quantum physics to build what appeared to be the world’s first unbreakable information link between an orbiting craft and its controllers. Laser beams carried the messages. The test raised the prospect that Beijing might one day possess a super-secure network for global communications.That same month, China finished deploying the last of 35 navigation satellites, the completion of a third-generation network intended to give its military new precision in conducting terrestrial strikes.A rugged area of mountains and deserts in northwestern China hosts a tidy complex of buildings with large roofs that can open to the sky. Recently, analysts identified the site in the Xinjiang region as one of five military bases whose lasers can fire beams of concentrated light at American reconnaissance satellites, blinding or disabling their fragile optic sensors.Mr. Biden is inheriting a range of responses to Beijing’s antisatellite moves, including arms both offensive and defensive, initiatives both federal and commercial, and orbital acts both conspicuous and subtle. Analysts call the situation increasingly delicate.Mr. Work, the third-offset official from the Obama era, and Mr. Grant, his former Pentagon colleague, warned in a report that Beijing might eventually beat Washington at its own game.“The Soviets were never able to match, much less overcome, America’s technological superiority,” they wrote. “The same may not be true for China.”</body>

	<title>Trump Wants Back on Facebook. This Star-Studded Jury Might Let Him.</title>
	<author>Ben Smith</author>
	<body>They meet mostly on Zoom, but I prefer to picture the members of this court, or council, or whatever it is, wearing reflective suits and hovering via hologram around a glowing table. The members include two people who were reportedly on presidential shortlists for the U.S. Supreme Court, along with a Yemeni Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a British Pulitzer winner, Colombia’s leading human rights lawyer and a former prime minister of Denmark. The 20 of them come, in all, from 18 countries on six continents, and speak 27 languages among them.This is the Oversight Board, a hitherto obscure body that will, over the next 87 days, rule on one of the most important questions in the world: Should Donald J. Trump be permitted to return to Facebook and reconnect with his millions of followers?The decision has major consequences not just for American politics, but also for the way in which social media is regulated, and for the possible emergence of a new kind of transnational corporate power at a moment when almost no power seems legitimate.The board will seriously examine the Trump question, guided by Facebook’s own rules as well as international human rights law. If Facebook accepts its rulings, as it has pledged to do, as well as the board’s broader guidance, the company will endow this obscure panel with a new kind of legitimacy.“Either it’s nothing, or it’s the New World Order,” said a lecturer at Harvard Law School who studies content moderation, Evelyn Douek, who pushed Facebook to send the Trump case to the Oversight Board.It might surprise you to know that such a board exists — that one of the world’s most powerful executives would go to such lengths to give up control of a key tool, the delete key. But after four years of unending criticism for being too slow to act on the rise of right-wing populism on the platform, and parallel complaints from the right over alleged censorship, you can see why Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, was drawn to the idea of handing the thorniest calls off to experts, and washing his hands of the decisions.Mr. Zuckerberg floated the notion of an independent content moderation body back in 2018, and Facebook finally appointed its members last May. The company put $130 million into a legally independent trust with a staff of 30, which two people involved said paid six figures annually to each board member for what has become a commitment of roughly 15 hours a week. The board is structurally independent, and Mr. Zuckerberg has promised its decisions will be binding. The members I spoke to said they felt no particular obligation to Facebook’s shareholders. The company, meanwhile, has pledged to abide by decisions on topics as varied as nudity and hate speech, in hopes that it will ultimately shield Mr. Zuckerberg from making endless, impossibly controversial public choices.But the board has been handling pretty humdrum stuff so far. It has spent a lot of time, two people involved told me, discussing nipples, and how artificial intelligence can identify different nipples in different contexts. Board members have also begun pushing to have more power over the crucial question of how Facebook amplifies content, rather than just deciding on taking posts down and putting them up, those people said. In October, it took on a half-dozen cases, about posts by random users, not world leaders: Can Facebook users in Brazil post images of women’s nipples to educate their followers about breast cancer? Should the platform allow users to repost a Muslim leader’s angry tweet about France? It is expected to finally issue rulings at the end of this week, after what participants described as a long training followed by slow and intense deliberations.And it has faced questions about whether it would ever be more than a public relations gesture, including from critics who started an alternate “Real Facebook Oversight Board” to call for a sweeping crackdown on the platform. So when Facebook suspended Mr. Trump’s account indefinitely after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, the Oversight Board’s leaders didn’t disguise their eagerness to take on a big and meaty question.“This is the kind of case the oversight board is for,” said one of the board’s co-chairs, Jamal Greene, a former Supreme Court clerk and Kamala Harris aide who is the Dwight Professor of Law at Columbia University Law School and a prominent legal scholar. Another board co-chairman, the conservative former federal judge and Stanford law professor Michael McConnell, told me before Facebook finally referred the case that it was “quite appropriate for the board to hear” the questions raised by the Trump ban.It’s hard to imagine a more consequential case. The decisions by Twitter and Facebook to bar Mr. Trump immediately reshaped the American political landscape. In the course of a few hours after the Capitol riots, they simply vaporized the most important figure in the history of social media.The board took up the case Thursday, and will appoint a panel of five randomly selected board members, at least one of them American, to decide what is to be done with Mr. Trump’s account. The full, 20-person board will review the decision, and could reinstate Mr. Trump’s direct connection to millions of supporters, or sever it for good.The odds aren’t bad for Mr. Trump. Kate Klonick, an assistant professor at the St. John’s University School of Law who described platforms as “New Governors” in an influential 2018 Harvard Law Review article, said the reaction to the Trump ban among legal academics has been “tepid and very qualified support for the outcome from people who are experts in free speech, mixed with long-term fear about what this is all going to mean for democracy going forward.” Noah Feldman, the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, who first brought the notion of a Facebook Supreme Court to the company, said he thought conservatives dismayed by the recent crackdown might be surprised to find an ally in this new international institution. “They may come to realize that the Oversight Board is more responsive to freedom of expression concerns than any platform can be, given real world politics,” he said.Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president for global affairs, said he was “very confident&quot; the board would affirm the company’s decision to suspend Mr. Trump’s account the morning after the mob stormed the Capitol, though less sure what recommendations it would make about allowing him to return to the platform in the future.The Oversight Board appears particularly relevant right now because it represents a new kind of governance, in which transnational corporations compete for power with democratically elected leaders. The board doesn’t have “Facebook” in its name, or Facebook blue on its website, for a reason: Mr. Clegg said he hoped it would “develop a life of its own,” get buy-in from other platforms (no dice so far), and “even be co-opted in some shape or form by governments.” And if this sounds far-fetched, or sinister, consider the trends in public opinion: A global survey last week by the P.R. firm Edelman found that governments, the media and nongovernmental organizations alike had seen the public’s faith sink in the Covid era. The all-caps headline: “BUSINESS NOW ONLY INSTITUTION SEEN AS BOTH COMPETENT AND ETHICAL.”That’s how some of the board’s members see it as well.“Practically the only entities that I trust less than the companies would be the government,” Mr. McConnell said.To others, the idea of global corporations becoming de facto governments is dystopian — and the board’s promise reflects low expectations for democratic governance. “No board, whether corporate or ‘independent,’ can or should replace a parliament,” said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch politician who is a member of the “real” board. “Both the storming of the Capitol and social media companies’ panicked reactions have laid bare the depth of unchecked power social media companies hold over the public debate and public safety. The balancing and weighing of rights and interests belongs with democratically legitimate decision makers. There must be accountability beyond self-regulation.”Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Mr. Clegg, a former British political leader who is now a top Zuckerberg deputy, acknowledged the criticism, but said he did not see an alternative right now.“Everybody is making a reasonable point when they say, ‘I’m uneasy about this display of private corporate power over the public realm.’ It strikes at the rawest of raw nerves,” he said. But, he said, the company can’t wait for democracy to catch up and institute laws and norms around Facebook’s behavior.“Those norms don’t exist, and in the meantime we can’t duck making decisions in real time,” he said.Executives at other platforms remain skeptical, and show no sign of jumping aboard. And the board will have to weather American domestic politics, with pressure from an anti-corporate left and a populist right embodied by Fox News’s Tucker Carlson (“an extraordinarily articulate polemicist,” Mr. Clegg said). And Mr. Clegg said he hoped the board would find a way to have its five American members directly involved in this ruling through “some bespoke arrangement so they can provide particular input and insight into this decision.” But there’s no clear mechanism for favoring Americans, and the connections between the board and real-world politics are already getting complicated. One prominent member, the Stanford law professor Pam Karlan, has recused herself to help with the Biden transition, an Oversight Board official said.The board’s decision in the Trump case — due before the end of April — has obvious implications here in the United States, but it could also set the company’s policy in other big democracies with leaders of the same new right-wing populist ilk, like Brazil, India and the Philippines. For them, too, Facebook is a major source of power, and they’re now eying Palo Alto warily. The Trump ban is “a dangerous precedent,” an official in India’s ruling party tweeted. In Brazil, as in the United States, conservatives have begun shifting their followers to Telegram, a messaging service.The right-wing populists aren’t the only ones worried. Leaders from Germany to Mexico have also objected to the notion that an American company could control their speech. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico compared it to the Spanish Inquisition. And some analysts believe that politics and law will ultimately do away with the big centralized platforms — Twitter, YouTube and Facebook — replacing them with a more fragmented set of tools with “the killer feature of not having a San Francisco kill-switch.”These global politics are complex, and constantly shifting. The Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, who built an opposition movement on social media, is among those who criticized Facebook’s decision to remove Mr. Trump from the platform, fearing that governments like Russia’s would use the same logic to stifle dissenters like him. On Friday, Mr. Clegg said the company was resisting Russian government demands to remove posts in support of Mr. Navalny.The emergence of this new kind of governance, and this new kind of decision, signals the return of gatekeeping. The moves also underscore who really keeps the gate, and who has lost that power. That space between government and corporate power used to be occupied by a widely trusted mass media.“The media played a role of this sort at a certain point in history, as a kind of trusted intermediary, but there are good reasons for it not to play that role anymore,” Professor Greene said. “There’s got to be something in between private commercial incentives and government.”</body>

	<title>Some Republicans have turned to conspiracy theories and misinformation to explain the Capitol attack.</title>
	<author>Astead W. Herndon</author>
	<body>Immediately after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, all corners of the political spectrum repudiated the mob of President Trump’s supporters. Yet within days, prominent Republicans, party officials, conservative media voices and rank-and-file voters began making a rhetorical shift to try to downplay the group’s violent actions.In one of the ultimate don’t-believe-your-eyes moments of the Trump era, these Republicans have retreated to the ranks of misinformation, claiming it was Black Lives Matter protesters and far-left groups like antifa who stormed the Capitol — in spite of the pro-Trump flags and QAnon symbology in the crowd. Others have argued that the attack was no worse than the rioting and looting in cities during the Black Lives Matter movement, often exaggerating the unrest last summer while minimizing a mob’s attempt to overturn an election.The shift is revealing about how conspiracy theories, deflection and political incentives play off one another in Mr. Trump’s G.O.P. For a brief time, Republican officials seemed perhaps open to grappling with what their party’s leader had wrought — violence in the name of their Electoral College fight. But any window of reflection now seems to be closing as Republicans try to pass blame and to compare last summer’s lawlessness, which was condemned by Democrats, to an attack on Congress, which was inspired by Mr. Trump.“The violence at the Capitol was shameful,” Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, tweeted at 6:55 a.m. the morning after the attack. “Our movement values respect for law and order and for the police.” But now, in a new video titled “What Really Happened on January 6th?” Mr. Giuliani is among those who are back to emphasizing conspiracy theories.“The riot was preplanned,” said Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City. “This was an attempt to slander Trump.” He added, “The evidence is coming out.”Suzanne Doherty, 67, who traveled from Michigan to be in Washington on Jan. 6 to support Mr. Trump, came away feeling confused and depressed over the invasion of the Capitol and not trusting the images of the mob.“I heard that on antifa websites, people were invited to go to the rally and dress up like Trump supporters, but I’m not sure what to believe anymore,” she said. “There were people there only to wreak havoc. All I know is that there was a whole gamut of people there, but the rioters were not us. Maybe they were antifa. Maybe they were B.L.M. Maybe they were extreme right militants.”The conjecture that the mob was infiltrated by Black Lives Matter and antifa has been metastasizing from the dark corners of the pro-Trump internet to the floors of Congress and the Republican base, even as law enforcement officials say there is no evidence to support it. The authorities are now flagging threats of violence and rioting leading up to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s inauguration.That has not stopped Republican lawmakers and some of their constituents from pushing these narratives to defend Mr. Trump.</body>

	<title>Biden Is the Oldest President to Take the Oath</title>
	<author>Johnny Diaz</author>
	<body>When Joseph R. Biden Jr. took the oath of office on Wednesday, he became be the oldest person ever sworn in as president. Mr. Biden turned 78 in November.During the campaign, Mr. Biden addressed his age head-on in interviews and presented himself as a “transition candidate” who would help nurture new Democratic talent.“It’s a legitimate question to ask about my age,” Mr. Biden said on “The View,” adding, “Hopefully, I can demonstrate not only with age has come wisdom and experience that can make things a lot better.”Mr. Biden leveraged his age as a strength in the election and campaigned on two key messages, according to one historical expert.“The first one: ‘I am not him,’ meaning Trump,” Jeffrey A. Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said on Wednesday. “The second was, ‘I am an adult and I will bring back normalcy and I will bring back a sense of decency and demonstrate maturity.’”Here is a look at some of the oldest and youngest presidents to take office.Before President Biden was sworn in on Wednesday, President Donald J. Trump held the record for the country’s oldest chief executive. He was 70 in January 2017, when he became the 45th president.Before him, President Ronald Reagan was the oldest president. He was 69 in 1981 when he was inaugurated for his first term.In a debate with Walter Mondale during his 1984 re-election campaign, Mr. Reagan made light of the issue of age.“I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign,” he said. “I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”Mr. Reagan was 77 after his second term, the oldest president to leave office.More than a century before him, William Henry Harrison held the distinction of being the oldest president at the time, when he was inaugurated in 1841 at age 68. Mr. Harrison, who had caught a cold that developed into pneumonia, died after 32 days in office. He became the first president to die in office and to date, has served the shortest tenure in U.S. presidential history.At 96, Jimmy Carter is the oldest living former president.Many people may think John F. Kennedy, who was inaugurated in 1961 at age 43, was the youngest president. But that distinction belongs to Theodore Roosevelt, who was 42 in September 1901, when he assumed the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley.“I don’t think most Americans have ever seen a moving picture of Teddy Roosevelt and not, certainly, while he was president,” Professor Engel said, explaining why people may think of Kennedy as the youngest American president. “They don’t have a mental image of a young man in the White House at that age, whereas John F. Kennedy was all about the image and moving images.”Other youthful presidents include Ulysses S. Grant, who was 46 when he took office in 1869; Bill Clinton, who was also 46 at his first inauguration, in 1993; and Barack Obama, who was 47 at his first inauguration in 2009. Three of the five youngest presidents were Democrats; Roosevelt and Grant were Republicans.As dictated by the United States Constitution, the president must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old and a resident of 14 years.The qualifications for president have not changed since George Washington first took office at 57 in 1789, according to the Library of Congress. He was sworn in on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York City, then the capital of the United States.A 2011 JAMA article on presidential aging, which did not include Mr. Trump, observed that the average age of a U.S. president at inauguration was 55.1 years.A similar ranking found that on average, presidents are sworn in at 55, according to potus.com, a project created by Bob Summers in 1996 as part of a graduate school project at the University of Michigan School of Information.“Most of the people that become president usually need to build a body of work to prove to voters what they stand for and how they will get things done,” Mr. Summers said.“That usually precludes much younger presidents,” he added. “And with the shorter life expectancies in the early days of the U.S., there were not as many people who would run as older candidates.”There have been two father-and-son sets of presidents, and both were similar in age when they each first took office.John Adams was 61 when he became the second president, in 1797. His son John Quincy Adams was sworn in as the sixth president at 57 in 1825.George Bush was 64 at his inauguration in 1989. Twelve years later, he watched his eldest son, George W. Bush, inaugurated at 54.Alain Delaquérière contributed research.</body>

	<title>After the Capitol Was Stormed, Teachers Try Explaining History in Real Time</title>
	<author>Amelia Nierenberg</author>
	<body>To explain the tumultuous events of recent days, Tracy Merlin used an analogy her second-grade class would understand: the eternal struggle between dog people and cat people.“Let’s say that half of the country thinks dogs are the best, and half of the country thinks cats are the best,” said Ms. Merlin, who teaches in Broward County, Fla. “But then it just turns out that the dogs won the election.”“Do you think that people can still like cats and that maybe there can be some conversation?” she asked. “They can still like cats,” ventured Ander, 8, his blue headphones clamped over his ears.Ms. Merlin scanned the sea of little heads floating in their individual squares. “Do you think it’s OK for the cat people to break into all the pet stores when they’re upset?” she asked.“No,” Ander said. “Because that’s illegal.”A riot at the U.S. Capitol. The second impeachment of Donald J. Trump. And, despite it all, a transfer of power. The events of the past few weeks have been mind-boggling for many adults. How, then, to explain them to students, be they preschoolers meeting on socially distanced circle rugs or college students peering anxiously into seminar videochats?Across the United States, educators have rerouted their syllabuses toward the news. They have turned to science fiction, Shakespearean tragedy and the fall of Rome in search of parallels to help their students process the often frightening and surely historic events.“When I was a kid, the Challenger blew up,” Ms. Merlin, 46, said the day before the inauguration of President Biden. She remembers exactly what she was doing when the space shuttle exploded after liftoff in 1986 — just as her parents remember exactly what they were doing when John F. Kennedy was assassinated.“I don’t know if this is this generation’s moment,” she continued. “But I know there are things that stick with them from a very young age. If I can let them know that it’s important to know about what is happening around you, and be informed, and have the facts, then I feel like I’ve done my job.”College students have needed help framing these turbulent weeks, too. On Wednesday, the morning of the inauguration, 180 students logged on to Steven G. Noll’s introductory American history class at the University of Florida. The lecture topic was post-Civil War Reconstruction. Professor Noll, 68, easily plucked out uncomfortable parallels to the present.“Words matter,” he said. What were once called “riots” that culminated in the killing of newly freed and enfranchised Black people are now called “massacres,” he said. He showed a picture of a stone monument in Louisiana, erected in the memory of three “heroes,” who in 1873, the monument said, “fell in the Colfax riot fighting for white supremacy.” Those rioters killed 150 Black people.He said that carrying the Confederate flag, as one of the Trump supporters in the mob that took over the Capitol on Jan. 6 was photographed doing, tells us “that they are fighting for white supremacy.” The night of the Capitol riot, many of Melissa Deokaran’s middle school students in Washington, had lain awake, some hearing Trump supporters shouting in their alleys. At least three have parents in the D.C. National Guard who went to protect the Capitol.So the day after, Ms. Deokaran used her Latin class to discuss the etymology of “invasion,” “insurrection” and “coup.” Then on Thursday, after Mr. Biden had assumed office, Ms. Deokaran taught the root of “inauguration,” “resilient” and “union.”“I think it’s important for us to understand what a union means and what it means to be unified,” Ms. Deokaran, 32, told her class. In Latin, she said, “it means ‘one.’ In English, union means being ‘joined as one.’”Across the country, schools occupy a fraught political space. The ways that children learn history, civics and literature can shape the votes they will one day cast. Teachers work hard to ensure their classrooms are safe for everyone to express opinions and disagree. But the pandemic has eroded that four-walls privacy. Teachers have had to navigate the political passions of their communities in a time of intense division. Parents with strong opinions might be nearby as students learn virtually — and objecting to characterizations of polarizing events. “I’ve had constant meetings and emails and such with a fairly aggressive contingent of parents that feels very strongly about the way that I am dealing with these issues in my classroom,” said James Mayne, who teaches at a Seventh-day Adventist school in Clark County, Wash., that he said leans conservative.On Thursday, Mr. Mayne asked his 11th-grade U.S. history students to compare Mr. Biden’s inaugural speech with Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural. Then he opened the floor for discussion, steering students toward the struggles both presidents faced in reuniting the country.“I would have a very difficult time finding ground with white supremacists,” said Jordan, 16.“White supremacists are an extreme part,” retorted Talia, 16, who called herself a liberal. “I have a bunch of people on the other side of my life that are not racists. They may have a bad way of explaining things sometimes, but in their hearts they are good people and they love everyone.”If you cannot look past language, Talia said, you cannot find middle ground.In politically conservative or even just politically mixed places, some schools have shied away from political discussions. Some school districts, like Bangor, Maine, did not broadcast Mr. Biden’s inauguration because they feared violence. And teachers who live in divided areas must work hard to avoid seeming biased. Alyssa Kelly teaches 11th- and 12th-grade English in a conservative-leaning, rural district about 35 miles southwest of Bangor. Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.The day after the riot, one of her students, a vocal Trump supporter, came to class confused. He had spent the evening trying to parse memes, sound bites and his social media feeds. He just wanted a straight answer.What had actually happened, he asked. After they spoke about it as a class, Ms. Kelly said, he was frustrated with how his fellow Trump supporters had acted.“I am not necessarily confident that if he hadn’t had the space to wrestle with his own ignorance for a minute — in a way I didn’t judge him at all — he would have got to the same conclusion,” Ms. Kelly said. “I didn’t have to say anything political, really. I just had to unpack it for him, or help him unpack it.”Ms. Kelly, who teaches in a majority-white district, hung a print of “Golden Rule,” a Norman Rockwell piece depicting a racially and religiously diverse group of people under the American flag. When her students turn to say the Pledge of Allegiance, she hopes they remember who else lives in the country.“My students are going to graduate and, most likely, remain in their homogeneous perspectives and convenient, familiar contexts,” Ms. Kelly said. “This is one last chance to remind them that befriending someone who disagrees with you is actually possible.”To scythe through confusion, several teachers said they used a three-part query system: What do I know? What do I think I know? And what do I want to know? Whenever possible, they directed discussions back toward the curriculum, using primary sources as a guide.The day after the Capitol rampage, Nicole Hix turned class discussion in her Advanced Placement world history class toward the violence. Instead of asking her students at a private Catholic school in Houston to analyze documents from the reign of Louis XIV, Ms. Hix asked them to discuss recent pictures, headlines and tweets, just as they would any other primary source.“When it got awkward, I moved on,” Ms. Hix, 46, said. “It was a tough day. It was hard to swallow. A lot of them didn’t have questions, so I turned it into an Advanced Placement skills day.”One student, Sophia, said her peers kept their heads down and their mouths closed. She answered direct questions but mostly steered clear of sharing her opinion.“It’s our age,” said Sophia, 15. “We don’t want to lose any friends, but we also have beliefs. We can all tell that it’s very tense.”Back in Ms. Merlin’s second-grade class, she directed the discussion about cats and dogs toward the riot at the U.S. Capitol. It had happened two weeks before — eons in second-grade time. “We saw a lot of violence,” said Ms. Merlin, a local activist for gun violence prevention. “Do you girls and boys remember the pushing and the shoving? How did that make you feel?”“It was kind of sad to see that,” Logan, 8, said. “They could probably talk to people and just sort of figure this out, instead of breaking into the Capitol.”“What is something that you have to do with your ears when the other person is talking?” Ms. Merlin asked.Sierra, who is 7, unmuted herself. “You need to listen,” she said.Anemona Hartocollis contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>One Day’s Pandemic Losses: Among Thousands, a Father, a Child, a Friend</title>
	<author>Manny Fernandez</author>
	<body>It was 3 a.m. when Latraile Williams was startled from her sleep in her family’s Gainesville, Fla., home with a phone call. The voice on the other end, the doctor, sounded urgent, his words coming in slow bursts. Her husband of 23 years had very little time left. “Dear God,” she began to pray. “Dear God, give me strength.”Ten minutes later, she received a second call. It was too late.Her husband, Stacey Williams, a beloved youth football coach and father of five, had died from complications of Covid-19. All that was left was for her to replay the cellphone video that he had made from his hospital bed.Looking into the camera with tubes in his nose, Mr. Williams tells his wife and children not to stress, that he is a fighter guided by his faith in God. He asks his children to stay positive and strong for their mother. “Keep hanging on,” he says, later adding, “I love y’all.”As the national death toll from the virus nears 400,000, a horrifying milestone, people in the United States have been dying of Covid-19 at the highest rate of the pandemic. The new tally is the equivalent of wiping out a city the size of Oakland, Calif. It is on the order of Sept. 11 deaths more than a hundred times over. At that scale, the human brain compensates with a defense that political psychologists call “psychic numbing.”On one single day in a monthlong period during which the United States lost more people to Covid-19 than in any other during the pandemic, Mr. Williams was among more than 2,000 Americans with the virus to die.Along with Mr. Williams, Jose H. Garcia, 59, the longtime chief of the Roma Police Department in the South Texas border region who was known to friends and family as Beto, died of Covid complications. So did Nelson Prentice Bowsher II of Washington, 80, an affordable housing advocate whose family’s feed mill business was a fixture of South Bend, Ind., through the 1960s.Combing through hundreds of local obituaries, county records and interviews with families, New York Times reporters were able to piece together a tapestry of some of the lives lost on that day, Jan. 4.Sherri Rasmussen, 51, of Lancaster, Ohio, was one. She is survived by a daughter who said she would always remember the day her mother gave her purse to a woman who complimented it in a CVS store, saying, “I want to pay it forward.” And then there was Pedro Ramirez, 47, who loved his Puerto Rican homeland, salsa dancing and restoring Volkswagen bugs. Days before, he told his wife, Shawna Ramirez, about the vaccine and how people like him, with chronic medical issues, would be getting it soon.“I told him I loved him and how sorry I was that he had to be in the hospital by himself,” said Ms. Ramirez, 52, who works in a bridal salon in Macon, Ga.The surge in deaths reflects how much faster Americans have spread the virus to one another since late September, when the number of cases identified daily had fallen to below 40,000. Since early in the pandemic, deaths have closely tracked cases, with about 1.5 percent of cases ending in death three to four weeks later.A range of factors — including financial pressure to return to workplaces, the politicization of mask-wearing and a collective surrender to the desire for social contact — has driven the number of new cases being reported to more than 200,000 a day. At the same time, the pace of death has also quickened: The first 100,000 U.S. deaths were confirmed by May 27; it then took four months for the nation to reach 200,000 deaths, and three more months to surpass 300,000 deaths on Dec. 14. By contrast, the latest wrenching 100,000-death count has occurred over a span of only five weeks.In 30 states, at least one in a thousand residents has died from the virus, with nine of those states — Alabama, Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Texas and Wisconsin — crossing the threshold since Jan. 1, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Last week, more than 4,000 deaths were reported on some days, an average of nearly three deaths each minute. Nearly one-quarter of Los Angeles County’s total Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in the past two weeks.Because the virus’s collective toll is taken from so many corners of the country, it can often feel fragmented — as though, said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, “this thing that is happening to hundreds of thousands of families is still somehow under the surface.”But the lives of the people who died on one day, and those they left behind, reflect the individual holes in families, friendships and communities that make up an extraordinary national loss.Mr. Williams, 53, a lifelong University of Florida Gators fan, spent a quarter-century coaching youth football, and made it his business to teach young men the larger lessons of life off the field. He spent so many years mentoring and coaching that most people just knew him as “Coach.”The day after Thanksgiving, he developed a worrying cough. Not long after, his blood sugar levels dropped and he became lethargic. He was in a hospital for about a month before succumbing to the virus, making the video shortly before he was placed on a ventilator.“When I look back,” said Ms. Williams, 51, “I think he knew he might not make it and didn’t want us to be scared.”The Americans who died on Jan. 4, as in the recent months of the pandemic, were young and old. Many deaths are still taking place in nursing homes and long-term-care facilities, and among less affluent families who live in close quarters or cannot afford to stay away from a workplace. Especially at younger ages, deaths are occurring disproportionately among Black and Hispanic Americans.But no racial or socioeconomic group has been spared. Once concentrated in certain geographic areas, the virus has now penetrated nearly all parts of the country. Rural areas as well as urban have been hit hard.At 6:30 a.m., just a few hours after Mr. Williams took his last breath, Renie Bardeau, 86, died of virus-related complications 2,000 miles away in Glendale, Ariz.A photographer at Disneyland for nearly 40 years, from his early freelance days in 1959 until his retirement in 1998, Mr. Bardeau captured some of the amusement park’s most reprinted and beloved images, including an estimated 100,000 Mickey Mouse photos.At Disneyland, he chronicled presidential and celebrity visits, parades, ride openings — and often Walt Disney, who made rounds of the park in the morning before it opened. A Navy veteran who was the photographer on the U.S.S. Midway before going to work at Disneyland, Mr. Bardeau had been on dialysis in recent years. His daughter, Deborah Bardeau, said the family believed he had contracted the coronavirus at a dialysis center in Glendale, where weekly virus deaths have recently reached new highs, according to data compiled by The Times.“It sapped him of every tiny last bit of energy,” Ms. Bardeau said of the virus. “My stepbrother had to hold the phone up so he could hear our voices.”Later that morning, about 125 miles to the south in Tucson, Ariz., a call came for Calvin Romrell, a retired Air Force officer, saying that his daughter Elisha Romrell, 23, had died of Covid complications. Ms. Romrell, who had Down syndrome and an associated heart condition, lived with her parents, who took care to wear masks and practice social distancing because they knew she was at high risk of a severe case.But Covid-19 found its way into their household anyway, and “blew her over like a feather in the wind,” her father said. Ms. Romrell graduated from high school and attended a community center for people with developmental disabilities. She loved to laugh, her father said, and often held his hand. “That’s what I have echoing in my memory, the feeling of her hand in mine as I would help her from place to place.”“Even if you’re in a high-risk category, that doesn’t mean you’re not dear to a family, and that you don’t leave a big hole,” Mr. Romrell said. “The structure of our life was taking care of her.”Epidemiologists hoped that Covid-19 deaths would decline as the highest-risk Americans were vaccinated this month, including those over 65, health care workers and people with underlying medical conditions. But on Friday, federal health officials warned that a fast-spreading, far more contagious variant of the coronavirus is now projected to become the dominant source of infection in the United States. Though the variant is not more deadly, it could fuel so many new cases that deaths would remain at wrenchingly high levels.The first variant case in California was identified only a few days before Jan. 4, when the family of Laurie Lucero, 53, a San Bernardino County hospital clerk, learned that she had succumbed to the virus. That was just two days after her sister Cathy Benita Smith, 61, died of complications from the virus in Illinois.Another sister is currently battling the virus in a Los Angeles hospital.“It’s like your whole family is just vanishing,” said Priscilla Hernandez, 50, the only surviving sister (one died in 2013) who has not had the virus.Her voice shaking as she described the suddenness of the losses, Ms. Hernandez, who lives in Texas, recalled learning in the days before Christmas that two of her sisters had been hospitalized within days of each other.The sisters had called one another frequently since their mother died of cancer in July. In group chats, they traded memories of their childhood in Los Angeles, where their mother cleaned houses to put them through Catholic school. After their mother’s death, the sisters tried to cheer one another up. They shared photos and talked about what they were cooking for the holidays: tamales with pork, red chiles and olives, as well as pozole, a spicy Mexican stew traditionally made at Christmas.“First, we were all talking to each other and laughing, and in a split of a second, they are hospitalized,” Ms. Hernandez said.“I stay up late just thinking about everything,” she added. “It consumes you.”Mitch Smith and Steven Moity contributed reporting.

	<title>Biden Is Vowing to Reopen Schools Quickly. It Won’t Be Easy.</title>
	<author>Dana Goldstein</author>
	<body>In his first 48 hours in office, President Biden sought to project an optimistic message about returning the nation’s many homebound students to classrooms. “We can teach our children in safe schools,” he vowed in his inaugural address.The following day, Mr. Biden signed an executive order promising to throw the strength of the federal government behind an effort to “reopen school doors as quickly as possible.”But with about half of American students still learning virtually as the pandemic nears its first anniversary, the president’s push is far from certain to succeed. His plan is rolling out just as local battles over reopening have, if anything, become more pitched in recent weeks.Teachers are uncertain about when they will be vaccinated and fearful of contagion. With alarming case counts across the country and new variants of the coronavirus emerging, unions are fighting efforts to return their members to crowded hallways. Their reluctance comes even as school administrators, mayors and some parents feel increased urgency to restore educational business-as-usual for the millions of students who are struggling academically and emotionally.Given the seemingly intractable health and labor challenges, some district officials have begun to say out loud what was previously unthinkable: that schools may not be operating normally for the 2021-22 school year. And some labor leaders are seeking to tamp down the expectations Mr. Biden’s words have raised.“We don’t know whether a vaccine stops transmissibility,” said Randi Weingarten, the powerful president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second-largest teachers’ union.Some virus experts, however, have said there is reason to be optimistic on this question.Ms. Weingarten said a key to returning teachers to classrooms in the coming months, even before widespread vaccinations, would be promises to allow those with health conditions, or whose family members have compromised immune systems, to continue to work remotely; in-school virus testing; the collection of centralized data on the number of Covid-19 cases in specific schools; and assurances from districts that they would shut down schools when cases occur.Fights over those very demands have slowed and complicated reopenings across the country. But Ms. Weingarten also indicated that Mr. Biden’s efforts to fill classrooms would be greeted more favorably than those of Donald J. Trump and his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, who were largely reviled by public school educators.“Don’t underestimate the bully pulpit,” she said. “Truth and trust are so important.”Mr. Biden’s executive order directs federal agencies to create national school reopening guidelines, to support virus contact tracing in schools and to collect data measuring the impact of the pandemic on students. The White House is also pushing a stimulus package that would provide $130 billion to schools for costs such as virus testing, upgrading ventilation systems and hiring staff.School leaders are eagerly awaiting additional cash from Washington, which could amount to several thousand dollars per pupil. But they emphasize that it will be equally important for federal officials to directly address the anxiety about in-person work that has swept the teacher corps and that has been given an influential voice in places where teachers’ unions are powerful.The Trump administration fed that anxiety by demanding schools open while issuing vague and conflicting guidelines about how to do so safely.Robert Runcie, superintendent of Broward County Public Schools in South Florida, the nation’s sixth-largest district, said he would like to see Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, hold a news conference to discuss schools and “alleviate the fear people have.”Broward is not doing surveillance testing, but it has published a dashboard tracking known virus cases in its schools — about 2,000 among students and staff since the system reopened in October, serving about a third of its 260,000 students in person. Contact tracing suggested that 10 percent of those cases could have been caused by transmission in schools, Mr. Runcie said, and that the majority of those transmissions were quite likely connected to athletics.That is in line with other research suggesting that measures like masks can effectively mitigate virus spread in schools.The district required some teachers with health concerns to return to school buildings this month, in order to avoid a situation in which some students were learning online even within school buildings. In response, the local union sued; the case is currently in arbitration. The district’s bus drivers, food service workers, custodians and clerks are working full time without complaint, Mr. Runcie said.The system lost 9,000 students this year as parents sought alternatives to virtual education. If some families choose to stay permanently in private and charter schools, district funding could plummet, forcing layoffs, Mr. Runcie warned. He argued that the union’s fight was shortsighted.Anna Fusco, president of the Broward Teachers Union, said most county teachers were willing to be vaccinated and to then work in person with safety precautions in place. Florida, like a majority of states, has not yet made teachers eligible for the vaccine.Disputes over teacher health exemptions are also central in Chicago, where the union has threatened to refuse to work in person because of what it says are unsanitary conditions in school buildings, which the district is currently reopening in phases.Kenzo Shibata, a high school civics and English teacher, hopes to continue working remotely. His wife has breast cancer and is about to restart chemotherapy. He is also managing remote learning for his second-grade son, a student in the district.Mr. Shibata, an official with the Chicago Teachers Union, said he would be open to returning to the classroom after he was vaccinated, even if his students were not yet vaccinated. The district has promised to directly disperse vaccines to educators beginning in February.But Mr. Shibata suggested that a safer course of action would be to put off in-person learning until the fall, especially given the reluctance of Black and Latino parents in Chicago to return their children to schools. He was skeptical, he added, of President Biden’s push to reopen schools within 100 days.“I think that’s arbitrary and a political statement, not a pedagogical statement or a science or health statement,” he said. “It doesn’t inspire a lot of faith in me.”Under the Trump administration, unions and public school advocates argued that schools could only reopen with an enormous infusion of federal funding to purchase sanitation equipment, lower class sizes to maintain social distancing and hire nurses and psychologists.Money is beginning to flow, but Marguerite Roza, a school finance expert at Georgetown University, said it was perhaps even more important for the federal government to shore up districts’ abilities to negotiate forcefully with their unions.The Biden administration could establish a clear threshold for community virus transmission, below which it would advise schools to stay open, Dr. Roza said, or even require them to do so in order to access federal dollars.Research has pointed to the potential to operate schools safely before teachers and students are vaccinated, as long as practices like mask wearing are adhered to, and especially when community transmission and hospitalization rates are controlled.Tying stimulus money to opening schools might be a heavier handed strategy than the new Democratic administration is comfortable with, especially given union reluctance. On Friday, a White House spokesman said partnership and cooperation with teachers’ unions would be central to reopening schools successfully.But Mr. Biden could also work to combat teachers’ anxiety by speaking to the rank and file directly.“The offer of money? I don’t know if that will really be the thing that gets people to go back right now,” Dr. Roza said. “The fear is real.”</body>

	<title>China’s College Graduates Can’t Find Jobs. The Solution: Grad School.</title>
	<author>Vivian Wang</author>
	<body>Graduation was fast approaching, but Yang Xiaomin, a 21-year-old college student in northeastern China, skipped her university’s job fair. Nor did she look for positions on her own. She didn’t think she had a chance of landing one.“Some jobs won’t even take résumés from people with bachelor’s degrees,” said Ms. Yang, who, along with a record 3.77 million of her peers, instead took the national entrance exam for graduate school last month. “Going to graduate school won’t necessarily help me get a better job, but it will at least give me more choices of opportunities.”China’s economy has largely rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic, with data released on Monday showing it has become perhaps the only major economy to have grown last year. Still, one area remains sorely lacking: the supply of desirable, well-paying jobs for the country’s rapidly ballooning count of university graduates. Most of the recovery has been fueled by blue-collar sectors such as manufacturing, on which the Chinese economy still relies heavily.With the encouragement of the government, many students are turning to a stopgap solution: staying in school. China’s Ministry of Education announced at the height of the outbreak that it would order universities to expand the number of master’s candidates by 189,000, a nearly 25 percent increase, to ease unemployment. Undergraduate slots would also increase by more than 300,000.Nearly four million hopefuls took the graduate entrance exam last month, an almost 11 percent increase from the year before and more than double the number from 2016.School is a common landing pad worldwide during times of economic uncertainty, but in China, the push to expand enrollment lays bare a long-running problem. Even before the pandemic, the country’s graduates complained that there were not enough suitable jobs. Official employment numbers are unreliable, but the authorities said in 2014 that unemployment rates for the college-educated two months after graduation were as high as 30 percent in some areas.As a result, many Chinese have worried that the expansion of graduate slots will increase already fierce competition for jobs, dilute the value of advanced degrees or postpone an unemployment crisis. “Are graduate students under siege?” the headline of one state-controlled publication read.The Communist Party in recent years has frequently linked the prosperity of college graduates not only to economic development, but also to “social stability,” worrying that they could be a source of political unrest if their economic fortunes falter.But in seeking to keep unemployment down for those workers, the government must also be careful not to inflate their hopes, said Joshua Mok, a professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who studies China’s education policy. “It may create a false expectation for those highly skilled people,” Professor Mok said. “The Chinese government has to watch out about how to manage these sorts of expectations.”The government’s expansion push is part of a broader, decades-long effort to increase university enrollment. In 1997, China had fewer than 3.5 million undergraduate and graduate students, according to official statistics. In 2019, there were more than 33 million, not counting online schools and adult higher education institutions.Per capita, the number of advanced degrees still lags that of developed countries. There are about two graduate students for every 1,000 Chinese residents, according to government statistics, compared with about nine in the United States. Still, China’s economy has not kept up with the rapid expansion of higher education, leaving each round of new graduates competing for a small pool of jobs.The pandemic has exacerbated those concerns. A report by Zhaopin, China’s biggest job recruitment platform, found that 26.3 percent of 2020 college graduates were unemployed last June. Jobs for fresh college graduates fell 7 percent from the same time the year before, the report said, while the number of applicants surged nearly 63 percent.“What the current Chinese economy needs is more people that have technically oriented qualifications, rather than only general academic degrees from universities,” Professor Mok said. “There’s a mismatch of skills.”The competition has led many students to feel that an advanced degree is practically mandatory. Ms. Yang, who is studying land resource management, said she had long known she would attend graduate school because her undergraduate degree alone was “too low quality.”She knew that competition for admission would increase after the outbreak. “If you choose to take the master’s exam, you can’t be afraid of there being a lot of other people,” she said.Others have been less accepting. On Weibo, where the hashtag “what do you think of the graduate exam craze?” has been viewed more than 240 million times, many have worried that teaching quality or the value of their degree would go down as enrollment shot up.Others have asked whether the government was simply putting off a surge in unemployment for a few years. Some worried that companies would raise their application standards higher. Still others wondered whether there would be enough dormitories to accommodate all students.“Enrollment expansion is not just a matter of arithmetic,” one person wrote. “We must think about how this will affect the overall development of education and society.”The concern reached such a pitch that it prompted a government response. Hong Dayong, a Ministry of Education official, acknowledged at a news conference last month that some universities had experienced teacher shortages as graduate programs grew. But he said that officials would introduce tighter quality-control measures and that the government would encourage universities to offer more vocationally focused master’s degrees in order to help graduates find jobs.The government has also ordered state-owned enterprises to hire more recent graduates and subsidized companies that hire them.The war in Ukraine. China’s officials and its media are increasingly repeating the Kremlin’s narrative about the conflict. This joint propaganda has undercut Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and has found a receptive audience in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.Relations with Europe. Chinese leaders have often viewed Europe as the softer wing of the Western world, unable and unwilling to contest China’s rise. But as the continent reassesses its security needs, that may change — and lead to a more antagonistic stance.A strict Covid policy. As China grapples with its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic, the government is following a “zero Covid” strategy. The approach has put hundreds of millions of people’s lives on pause and could have far-reaching effects.A pause on wealth redistribution. For much of last year, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, waged a fierce campaign to narrow social inequalities and usher in a new era of “common prosperity.” Now, as the economic outlook is increasingly clouded, the Communist Party is putting its campaign on the back burner.Some advice has been blunt. Chu Chaohui, a researcher at China’s National Institute of Education Sciences, told the state-owned Global Times tabloid that graduates should lower their sights. As they did so, they would find jobs in sectors such as food or parcel delivery, he said.Inflated expectations may indeed be heightening competition for jobs. According to Zhaopin, the recruiting website, there are about 1.4 positions available to college graduates for each applicant, even after the epidemic. But many graduates look only in the biggest cities or expect high salaries, Professor Mok said.Still, some students said the government’s encouragement of the pursuit of higher education would only strengthen those expectations.“Everyone has their own ambitions, even a little bit of arrogance,” said Bai Jingting, an economics student in eastern Anhui Province. Ms. Bai, 20, said she had visited her college’s job fair in the fall but hadn’t found any positions that seemed exciting enough. “Since I decided to apply for graduate school, of course I will think about how it should be easier to find a job afterward, and easier to find a job that I want.”Further fueling the competition is the fact that many students who had planned to study or work abroad no longer have that option.Before the pandemic, Fan Ledi, a recent graduate from the western province of Qinghai, had planned to move to Ireland for a one-year master’s program in human resource management. He wanted to work there afterward, excited by the prospect of learning about a new culture.But he has scrapped that plan and will look for jobs at home when he finishes his program, which he is completing online because of travel restrictions.“Irish people are having trouble finding work, let alone foreigners,” Mr. Fan said. He added that he was worried about discrimination, as anti-China sentiment rises in many Western countries. “I think going abroad to find work right now is decidedly impossible.”He is already attending job fairs, though he will not finish school until November. Recruiters tell him he is too early, but he asks them to take his résumé anyway.Given the jostling for both jobs and graduate school spots, Ms. Bai, in Anhui, shrugged at the government’s increase in master’s seats. Her major, economics, was one of the most popular, she said, and competition would always be fierce.“How much can enrollment expand?” she said. “It’s just a drop in the bucket.”Albee Zhang and Liu Yi contributed research.</body>

	<title>Did Candidates Flee to Vacation Homes? 5 Highlights From the Mayor’s Race</title>
	<author>Katie Glueck</author>
	<body>[Live N.Y.C. mayoral race primary results.]One of the main unanswered questions in this year’s mayoral race is how the introduction of ranked-choice voting will change the nature of the election.The first taste of how things will change came on Sunday, with an endorsement of two candidates, in ranked order.Other questions were also addressed last week, including how much time candidates spent outside of New York City during the pandemic, and how they view the long-term job prospects of the current police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea. (Hint: Count on a job opening in January.)Here are some key developments in the race:For months, New York mayoral campaigns, political strategists and officials have quietly grappled with one of the biggest uncertainties in the race: how to approach the new ranked-choice voting system in the June Democratic primary, for which New Yorkers will be asked to rank as many as five choices. Can a candidate draw contrasts without alienating a rival’s supporters? Are alliances in order? Do voters even understand the process?On Sunday, some of those private calculations were placed on public display in what was billed as the “first of its kind” ranked-choice endorsement in the race: State Senator Gustavo Rivera named Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, as his first choice, and Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, as his second.Both of those contenders are seeking to emerge as the standard-bearers for progressive voters in the party, in competition with candidates including Maya Wiley, who out-raised Ms. Morales but trails Mr. Stringer in the money race. Mr. Rivera stressed their New Yorker bona fides at a time when Andrew Yang — another leading candidate in the race — has faced scrutiny over his political ties to the city.The joint campaign event with Mr. Rivera was not a cross-endorsement, Mr. Stringer assured.“Obviously I don’t want her to be mayor,” Mr. Stringer cracked as he appeared with Ms. Morales, and they stressed their interest in educating New Yorkers about ranked-choice voting.But the moment offered an early glimpse of how the new system may shape coalitions and highlight rivalries — and how elected officials with endorsements to dole out may seek to wield their influence.Add Mr. Yang to the list of gambling and real estate executives eager to bring a full-fledged casino to New York City.Mr. Yang spent much of last week doubling down on his assertion that what New York City needs right now is a casino.During a discussion about the city’s grave fiscal needs and the imperative to draw tourists back, Mr. Yang argued that New York City should put a casino on Governors Island — to make the city money and to make it “more fun.”“That casino would generate so much money, it’d be bananas,” Mr. Yang said during the Jan. 14 interview.Casinos are currently prohibited on the island, but Mr. Yang’s endorsement of a city casino raised some eyebrows among political types because Bradley Tusk, who is advising Mr. Yang’s campaign, is also chairman of IG Acquisition. The company, which seeks to acquire businesses in the leisure, gaming and hospitality industries, recently raised $300 million in an initial public offering.Via text message, Mr. Tusk acknowledged discussing the idea of a Governors Island casino with Mr. Yang, but said the idea is for the city to own the casino — the opposite of the industry’s preference.He argued that because he and Mr. Yang are proposing a city-controlled casino, rather than a private operation, there is no possible conflict of interest. A city-owned casino might still benefit from a casino consulting firm, but Mr. Tusk said that his company is interested in finding ways for people to bet on video games like Fortnite or League of Legends.“The point of saying public owned was to both maximize revenue for the city and remove it as anything that involves me,” Mr. Tusk said.When Mr. Yang told The New York Times that he had spent “more time upstate than in the city over the last number of months,” his fellow mayoral candidates saw an opening and highlighted how they stayed put.One candidate who did not throw any shade at Mr. Yang was Raymond J. McGuire, a wealthy former Wall Street executive who, with his wife, owns a second home in the Hamptons. Speculation rose that Mr. McGuire’s campaign was silent because perhaps he had spent much of the pandemic outside of the city as well.After reviewing his calendar, Mr. McGuire’s campaign said that he spent the first three months of the pandemic in Manhattan, and then a total of three weeks in the Hamptons with his family from June to August.His campaign staff shared a schedule that indicated that Mr. McGuire worked and took meetings in both Manhattan and the Hamptons during the summer; The Times confirmed that several of those meetings — with future staff members and an influential Black activist, Kirsten John Foy — did take place.“It’s pretty clear from the exhaustive and transparent accounting of Ray’s whereabouts that he was not living in the Hamptons during Covid,” said Mr. McGuire’s spokeswoman Lupé Todd-Medina.The Times asked other candidates about their whereabouts from March to September. Ms. Wiley’s campaign said she spent 10 days outside of the city on Long Island in July, while Mr. Stringer said he spent three days in Connecticut with his wife’s family in August.Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, said he did not spend a full 24 hours outside of the city during that period. Mr. Adams, who slept at Brooklyn Borough Hall during the height of the pandemic, said he would spend eight to 12 hours visiting with his partner and family in New Jersey.Carlos Menchaca, a councilman from Brooklyn, said he spent a total of 14 days outside the city, mostly hiking and meditating but still working remotely. Ms. Morales said she spent two days in upstate New York in July, and one of those days was with her campaign team.Shaun Donovan, the former federal housing secretary, spent two weeks with his family in Washington, D.C., as they were in the process of moving to join him in Brooklyn, according to his campaign. Zach Iscol said he spent a total of 50 days outside of New York with his family in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in between working as deputy director at the Covid-19 field hospital at the Jacob Javits Center.If there is one candidate in the crowded mayoral field who is most likely to be impersonated on “Saturday Night Live,” it is probably Paperboy Prince, a rapper from Brooklyn.At an online mayoral forum last week, Paperboy performed a rap in support of universal basic income, took two actual pies to the face and expressed concern about waking up a roommate.Paperboy, who ran to be the first nonbinary member of Congress, wore large bedazzled sunglasses indoors and easily had the most colorful backdrop. The rapper won about 14,000 votes in the Democratic primary against Representative Nydia Velazquez last year.Paperboy’s platform includes canceling rent, legalizing marijuana and psychedelics, abolishing the police and issuing reparations to “Black and brown people for the Drug War.”Other unorthodox candidates have garnered attention over the years — if not many votes. Jimmy McMillan ran for governor and mayor on the “Rent is Too Damn High” platform. He released a music video and was played by Kenan Thompson on “S.N.L.” in 2010.The forum, held by the Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats, featured other lesser known candidates: Joycelyn Taylor, the head of a general contracting firm who talked about growing up in public housing; Aaron Foldenauer, a lawyer who bristled at not being featured on the same panel as the leading candidates; and Quanda Francis, an accountant who said she dropped out of high school, which she said was an example of the failures of the city’s education system.When Mayor Bill de Blasio made a major announcement last week about stricter disciplinary rules for officers, he did so without Commissioner Shea.The mayor said that the police commissioner was still recovering from the coronavirus. Yet the commissioner apparently felt well enough to conduct interviews with reporters earlier in the week, raising questions about his support of the new rules and of the mayor.What seems clear is that Commissioner Shea does not have the support of most of the mayoral candidates. Ms. Wiley, a former counsel to Mr. de Blasio, even called on the mayor to fire him.Several candidates have talked recently about what they want to see in the next police commissioner. Mr. Yang said he wants to hire a “civilian police commissioner” who was not a police officer and who is “independent from the culture of the Police Department.”Mr. Adams, a former police officer, said he would hire a female police commissioner.At the Brooklyn mayoral forum, Ms. Wiley and Mr. Stringer, the city comptroller, would not commit to hiring a person of color as police commissioner, but pledged that their administrations would be diverse. Mr. de Blasio picked three Irish-American leaders, and the Police Department has not had a Black commissioner since Lee P. Brown resigned in 1992.</body>

	<title>Europe Welcomes Biden, but Won’t Wait for Him</title>
	<author>Steven Erlanger</author>
	<body>BRUSSELS — Europe is eager for “a political climate change” after Joseph R. Biden Jr. is sworn in on Wednesday, but if the new American president is preoccupied with troubles at home it is prepared to move ahead in key areas on its own, European leaders and analysts say.European countries, with their own problems of division and the pandemic, understand Mr. Biden’s need to concentrate first on domestic issues of vaccination, employment, right-wing extremism and polarization, especially after the rampage on Capitol Hill.But global problems have accelerated under President Trump, and Europe cannot subordinate its own interests and agenda even to a desire for a reinvigorated alliance and “a political climate change,” said France’s minister of finance and the economy, Bruno Le Maire, emphasizing that this was not simply a French view but an increasing European consensus.Despite the Biden team’s expressed interest in a healthy trans-Atlantic relationship, America’s future now is less predictable and dependable, Mr. Le Maire suggested in an interview. There is deepening concern that the array of crises confronting the Biden administration will take time to work through and that there is no telling how they will be resolved.European leaders were “aghast” at the events in the Capitol, and “looking at that and the riots in many U.S. cities, there is a risk of American society being split and the American administration not being in a situation to assume its worldwide responsibilities,” Mr. Le Maire said.“The European Union and European countries have a strategic choice to make, either to wait for the United States and the Biden administration to take decisions, or to move on,” Mr. Le Maire said. “We need to move on the fight against climate change, the building of new industrial assets, innovation and pave the way for a new European continent that will be stronger, more independent and able to run the race of the new technologies.”This European concern about a more inward-looking United States is legitimate, said Charles A. Kupchan, a former Obama official and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, arguing that America’s domestic troubles “will hugely affect foreign policy.”Mr. Biden has surrounded himself with well-known liberal interventionists in foreign policy, but “you have in Biden someone who understands that the major national-security threat to the United States right now is us,” meaning Americans themselves, Mr. Kupchan said. “It’s the degree to which we’re facing an electorate at least half of which is in revolt.”As a politician with his eye on the midterm congressional elections, “Biden will focus like a laser in his first year on the pandemic, on reopening the economy, on unemployment, on infrastructure, on health care, on an economic stimulus,” Mr. Kupchan said. “There will be much less time, energy and money for foreign policy.”Sophia Besch and Luigi Scazzieri of the Center for European Reform argue in a new paper that “many Europeans will want to forget Trump’s presidency ever happened.” But they add, “Europe cannot continue to look to the U.S. to answer key questions on what its interests are and how it should pursue them.”That’s particularly true for defense, on which most European leaders agree more must be spent.Germany’s defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, asserts that Europeans cannot replace America as a security provider, as do Central and Eastern European leaders. But others, especially President Emmanuel Macron of France and the E.U. foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, argue that Europeans cannot be sure of America’s reliability.Mr. Biden’s victory should not distract or discourage Europeans from a goal of a more independent defense and more strategic autonomy, they say, even in the context of NATO.There are particular issues, like terrorism, instability in North Africa and migration, where Europeans feel they need to be able to act more effectively on their own.“Where we Europeans need to be careful about our expectations from the Americans is in our neighborhood,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy’s Institute of International Affairs. On issues including Belarus, Ukraine and the Balkans, “coordination with the U.S. is important, but we can’t expect the U.S. to step up its engagement,” she said.But after four years of Mr. Trump’s antagonism toward Europe, and the continuing popularity of many of his “America First” policies, Europeans are more convinced than before that alliance cannot mean subordination to Washington and requires more European capacity to act alone.“Our determination is to be a strong ally of the United States, but an ally does not mean that we submit,” Mr. Le Maire said. “We must make a clear difference between working together with the United States toward China, for instance, and working under the leadership of the United States. This is not the same.”Mr. Macron and other European leaders want a serious conversation with a new Biden team about a common strategy toward China, but “without having the United States explaining that this is our plan and you have to obey it — this would not be acceptable.&quot;He defended the sudden European deal with China on an investment treaty as in Europe’s interests and rejected the notion of Europe as the co-pilot in an American fighter jet aimed at Beijing.But together, “we must find a common response to China’s unfair practices, such as dumping, industrial subsidies, state-owned companies, non-reciprocity in public procurements and the manipulation of exchange rates,” Mr. Le Maire said.A serious effort at balancing mutual interests “could signify a new start in the relationship between our two continents,” he said.The key issues for Europe and a new Biden administration, he said, included trade, where both sides “need to end the cycle of sanctions and retaliation”; the fight against climate change, with a welcome for Mr. Biden’s pledge to rejoin the Paris climate accord; digital regulation and a fair system of digital taxation; and again, a joint strategy toward China.In many of these areas, Mr. Le Maire is echoing proposals made for a revived trans-Atlantic agenda by two of the main E.U. bodies, the European Commission and European Council, at the end of last year.How to regulate and tax global tech and internet companies is a prime concern. “The internet giants are able to present lies as reality and truth,” Mr. Le Maire said, citing false claims by Mr. Trump that he had won the election. “That kind of mix between lies and truth is to me the most important issue we have to deal with in our Western democracies.”But the answer could not be censorship, the way Twitter and Facebook banned Mr. Trump, he said. “I don’t think you can be the platform and the regulator at the same time,” no matter how good your intentions, he said. “Strong, credible regulation” could only be done by elected representatives, “who have the legitimacy to make law.”For all the legitimate concerns about American division and preoccupation, there is considerable optimism about Mr. Biden, said Patrycja Sasnal of the Polish Institute of International Affairs.The United States is “returning home,” she said. When Europe and America stand together, “then they get things done, and it will give them both greater agency in foreign policy.”</body>

	<title>San Francisco 49ers Increase Leeds United Ownership Stake</title>
	<author>Tariq Panja</author>
	<body>Two years after dipping their toe in English soccer, the N.F.L.’s San Francisco 49ers have doubled down on their bet.The 49ers on Monday announced that they had increased their ownership stake in the Premier League club Leeds United to 37 percent from 15 percent, a move that further embeds American interests in the world’s richest soccer league.Paraag Marathe, the 49ers executive who has held a seat on the Leeds United board since San Francisco’s initial investment in 2018, will become vice chairman of Leeds United, whose majority owner will remain Andrea Radrizzani, the Italian entrepreneur. The 49ers and Leeds United did not provide financial details of the deal to increase the N.F.L. team’s ownership stake, though it is likely to represent a significant premium on the amount the 49ers spent in 2018, when Leeds was still playing in England’s second-tier Championship.In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in July, Radrizzani boasted that his initial investment in Leeds of 100 million pounds (about $140 million) had tripled in value. If the club remains in the Premier League, he predicted its valuation could double again in the next three years.The deal with the 49ers also ends speculation about potential new investment in Leeds. Over the past year, Radrizzani openly talked about selling off more of his ownership stake in Leeds, a team he is hoping to return to its former status as a major player in English soccer.Marathe, whose duties with the 49ers include oversight of the team’s outside business ventures, told The New York Times in July of the 49ers’ wish to increase their investment in Leeds, and to complete a deal as quickly as possible.While a deal is now done, it was not quick, smooth or simple, Marathe said, because of complications created by the coronavirus pandemic.“I’ve been doing deals my whole career, and it’s always easier to have a meeting of the minds when the minds are actually physically next to each other, so that, first and foremost, made it very complicated,” Marathe said in a video interview in which he was joined by Radrizzani.Radrizzani confirmed he had talked to other parties about investing in Leeds United, including the Qatari owners of Paris St.-Germain, the perennial French champion.The 49ers’ new commitment to English soccer underlines the growing synergy and potential for growth that the owners of N.F.L. franchises see in English soccer. The Glazer family, which owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has controlled Manchester United since 2005; Arsenal is backed by the Los Angeles Rams owner E. Stanley Kroenke; and Fulham, which like Leeds United won promotion to return to the Premier League for this season, is owned by Shahid Khan, who also owns the Jacksonville Jaguars. Liverpool, the reigning Premier League champion, is controlled by Fenway Sports Group, owner of baseball’s Boston Red Sox. Crystal Palace and most recently Burnley have also attracted American investment in recent years.“I can’t really speak for other American owners and what they’re doing, but for us it’s about synergy and partnership,” Marathe said. “Whatever sport it is, it’s still operating under the same premise: You have media rights, you have ticket sales, you have commercial, hospitality and you have your players. Everything is the same.”The 49ers’ plan in increasing their stake, Marathe added, is to bring the team’s N.F.L. experience to bear on Leeds’s operations on and off the field, through shared proprietary analytics tools to best practices on management and staffing.Leeds, back in the Premier League after a 16-year absence marred by sporting and financial failures, has won plaudits for its swashbuckling, front-foot style of play under its Argentine coach, Marcelo Bielsa. But it remains some distance from recapturing the days when it was in the mix for the championship year after year.In its preparation for its return to the elite, Radrizzani said, Leeds spent the sixth-highest amount on securing new talent during the last off-season. That spending will continue, and be supported by the investment from the 49ers, Marathe said.“If we are able to stay in the Premier League, after two or three years I think this club could step up to be in the group of three or four clubs next to the big ones,” Radrizzani said, picking out Leicester City, the unheralded team that went from relegation danger to Premier League champion in the space of a year in 2016, as a trajectory he would like to emulate. Since Leicester’s title victory, its Thai owners have invested in new players, coaches and infrastructure to maintain the club’s place in the upper reaches of the league.“Our model, I think, is Leicester City,” Radrizzani said. “We have shared this a lot internally. If there’s a club I admire for what has been done in terms of football management, it’s Leicester.”Having completed the stake sale, Radrizzani acknowledged that he was now considering adding to his own portfolio, perhaps by buying other European soccer teams. The idea, he said, would be to find opportunities that would allow Leeds to develop players at smaller clubs, or to invest in larger ones that would allow him to develop their sporting and commercial models in concert with those at Leeds United.He said he would not consider, however, emulating Manchester City’s model of multiple-club ownership, with teams spread across multiple continents. Radrizzani said his sole focus would be on Europe.The relationship between Radrizzani and Marathe has grown to the point that the 49ers executive has come to refer to the Italian as his “brother.” Before the pandemic, Marathe was a frequent visitor to Leeds with Jed York, the 49ers’ chief executive, and an early riser to watch its games from his home in California.Not being able to travel to Leeds’s Elland Road stadium to witness the final weeks of the team’s promotion to the Premier League did not dull Marathe and the 49ers’ intent on following through with an expanded investment. Neither did the financial losses Leeds United has endured as a result of the pandemic, which Radrizzani estimated to be roughly 40 million pounds ($55 million).“Was it a blip on the radar or is it a blip on the radar? Certainly,” Marathe said of the pandemic’s effects on sporting finances. “Do I think sport is going to come roaring back in possibly a bigger way than pre-Covid? Absolutely. Otherwise we wouldn’t be doing this.”</body>

	<title>Covid Response Was a Global Series of Failures, W.H.O.-Established Panel Says</title>
	<author>Matt Apuzzo</author>
	<body>Laying bare a yearlong cascade of failures, a World Health Organization panel recounts in a damning report how governments and public health organizations worldwide responded slowly and ineffectively to the coronavirus, despite years of warnings.The interim report, an early blueprint for reform, describes the faulty assumptions, ineffective planning and sluggish responses — including missteps by the W.H.O., itself — that helped fuel a pandemic that has killed more than two million people.“We have failed in our collective capacity to come together in solidarity to create a protective web of human security,” the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response writes.Many of the failings, such as the inability of governments to obtain protective equipment or do widespread contact tracing, have long been painfully clear over the course of the pandemic. But the report is stark in its assessment that, time and again, those who were responsible for protecting and leading failed to do either.The panel, led by Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former president of Liberia, is still conducting its investigation. But in drafting an interim report, and laying out the scope of its inquiry, the panel makes clear that the world needs to rethink its approach to outbreaks.The report describes one failure leading to another, from the “slow, cumbersome and indecisive” pandemic alert system, to the years of preparedness plans that failed to deliver, to the disjointed and even obstructive responses of national governments.Public health officials stumbled, too. Investigators said they could not understand why a World Health Organization committee waited until Jan. 30 to declare an international health emergency. (The Chinese government had lobbied other governments against declaring such an emergency).And despite the decades of predictions that a viral pandemic was inevitable, and years of committees, task forces and high-level panels aimed at preparing the W.H.O. for that emergency, reforms were slow to come. “The failure to enact fundamental change despite the warnings issued has left the world dangerously exposed, as the Covid-19 pandemic proves,” the report says.But the W.H.O.'s stumbles did not excuse the repeated failing of world leaders. For even after health officials gave a clear warning signal, the report notes, “In far too many countries, this signal was ignored.”The report also faults public health leaders for responding slowly to early evidence that people without symptoms could spread the new coronavirus. Early reports out of China, and one in Germany, documented this phenomenon. But leading health agencies, including the World Health Organization, provided contradictory and sometimes misleading advice, a New York Times investigation previously found.W.H.O.’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, appointed the panel to review the world’s Covid-19 response. Although the panel said the report was based on hundreds of documents, expert consultations and more than 100 interviews with frontline responders, it is not clear if the investigators have spoken to key health officials or reviewed internal documents.Many of the initial findings have been previously identified or been obvious for many months. But the collection of mistakes remains shocking even when it is not surprising, and by spelling them out, the panel hopes to chart a course for change.The organization declined to comment on the report before its member governments had reviewed it.Details in the 34-page report are thin, but it says that China had genome sequencing evidence that a novel virus was circulating in Wuhan in December 2019. Health authorities there could have moved more quickly and decisively to contain the outbreak, the report says, yet country after country repeated many of the same mistakes.“There were lost opportunities to apply basic public health measures,” the report reads.Instead of rallying behind proven health responses, governments and their citizens were fractured. Mask-wearing and social distancing became political statements. Conspiracy theories spread wildly. And governments failed to conduct the routine testing and contact-tracing needed to control the disease.Too often, investigators found, national leaders made health decisions with an eye on keeping their economies afloat, though they did not single out many nations for criticism. That proved to be a false choice. The panel found that countries that responded forcefully and effectively to the outbreak also fared better economically even as the global economy lost more than $7 trillion.“This is clearly a case where billions can save trillions,” the report says.That conclusion is an implicit rebuke of countries like the United States, where President Trump demanded that the country stay open for business. “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” he said in late March, when 30,000 Americans had tested positive.That figure is now over 23 million, and the country leads the world with nearly 400,000 deaths.“Health containment measures should have been implemented immediately in any country with a likely case,” the report said. “They were not.”The Covid-19 pandemic has already forced public health officials to reconsider some of their assumptions. It had long been accepted, for example, that travel bans did more harm than good by delaying medical help and unfairly punishing countries. That thinking has shifted, and the panel declared that travel restrictions have “most likely been helpful in curbing transmission.”The interim report suggests that its final document will address more systemic challenges facing the World Health Organization, which operates by the consensus of national governments and has no authority to enforce its own rules. The report said there was a wide chasm between what was expected of the organization and how much money it receives.Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the organization, taking away its largest source of funding, but President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has said he would rejoin it.Looking forward, the panel noted that inequality imperiled the world’s vaccine rollout. To demonstrate that disparity, the report includes a chart showing when countries expected to vaccinate their populations.Rich countries like the United States expect to be nearly finished with their campaigns by the end of the year; poor countries are unlikely to have even vaccinated their vulnerable populations by then. Their vaccine campaigns are expected to continue until the end of 2023.“Whether you happen to be born in Liberia, or New Zealand, or anywhere else, should not be the factor that determines your place in the vaccine queue,” the report says.</body>

	<title>In Poor Madrid Neighborhood, Biggest Snowfall in Half Century Deepens Misery</title>
	<author>Raphael Minder</author>
	<body>MADRID — Even before Madrid’s biggest snowfall in half a century caused part of her roof to collapse this month, Manuela Reyes Flores and her family were without electricity and running water as winter set in on their impoverished neighborhood on the outskirts of Spain’s capital.So it was just one more level of misery for them and thousands of other residents of the neighborhood, Cañada Real, when the huge snowstorm two weeks ago blanketed Madrid in a foot and a half of snow. The capital region was paralyzed, and on Tuesday, Madrid was declared a disaster zone.“We’ve never had an easy life,” said Ms. Reyes Flores, who settled in Cañada Real two decades ago as part of its large Roma community. She and her family have had to light open fires to keep warm, cook food and heat water for bathing.“We had to build our own house, and we have always done our best to repair things without spending any money,” she said.“But I can tell you that this place has now gone from disastrous to simply unlivable,” she added as she placed a bucket under a leak from the hole in her ceiling caused by the weight of the fresh snow.Cañada Real, home to about 8,000 people, is one of Europe’s largest poverty-ravaged neighborhoods. While part of the area is dotted with brick-and-mortar houses, at least half of the people there live under corrugated roofs and tarpaulin, which is also used instead of glass windows.The neighborhood has been a political football for decades, with several layers of government and different municipalities sharing responsibility for the vast stretch of land. Amid the political foot-dragging, about 15 nongovernmental organizations have stepped in to help the most vulnerable in Cañada Real. The number of Spanish aid workers has also risen since the pandemic began, because travel restrictions have stopped them from working outside Spain.Olga San Martín, the co-founder of Olvidados, a small humanitarian aid organization, visited Bosnia in December to distribute winter clothing in refugee camps.“I consider life in Cañada Real to be just as horrendous as in Bosnia, except that it feels even more shocking and disgraceful, because we have allowed this to happen in the capital of Spain and within the European Union,” she said after surveying the snowstorm’s damage.In 2017, lawmakers agreed to dismantle part of Cañada Real and move thousands of residents to subsidized apartments around Madrid. But only 105 such apartments have been made available.In October, Naturgy, a utility, cut the electricity supply to most of Cañada Real, saying residents were making intensive, unregulated and unsafe use of its electricity even though the area had only four official customer accounts.The power cut led to clashes between the police and residents. The clashes intensified once the police moved in, detained a dozen people and destroyed several marijuana plots.In December, a group of experts from the United Nations urged Spanish authorities to restore the electricity, particularly to protect the approximately 1,800 children who live in the area.“You cannot punish an entire population for the crimes of a few,” said Javier Baeza, a priest who regularly visits Cañada Real to assist its residents. “The political handling of Cañada Real can only be called terrible.”Madrid’s City Hall, responding to emailed questions, described Cañada Real as a challenge rather than a failure, noting that its relocation plan had received “a strong boost in the past year.”It also noted that the problem of Cañada Real dates back decades.“If the solution was easy, it would have been solved, because during all this time, under all administrations, there have been people who have genuinely been very concerned by the situation there,” the city government said.Cañada Real was once a pathway for farmers to cross Spain in search of fresh grazing ground for their sheep. But starting in the 1960s, Madrid’s industrial expansion persuaded families to turn the land into vegetable gardens and eventually live on it.Over the years, as property developers took over other impoverished neighborhoods and evictions accelerated elsewhere in Madrid, Cañada Real’s population swelled. From the 1990s, migrants arrived in large numbers, particularly from Morocco and Romania.One local landmark is a church where drug dealers and users congregate and smoke heroin in full view of police officers patrolling the area. The police say they intervene only in an emergency, if there is violence or someone is in a critical health situation.Many residents eagerly await keys to the promised subsidized apartments so they can move on. But some have mixed feelings about leaving, worried about having to pay rent and possible tensions with new neighbors.“We all know each other around here, but I really don’t think that people living in any other part of Madrid would love to have a Gypsy family next door,” said Miguel Maya, who collects and sells scrap metal, like many in the Roma community.Rather than leave, some residents want the authorities to invest in basic infrastructure and legalize their longstanding presence there.Carmen Carbonell Escudero, 68, lives in Cañada Real with her husband. Even though they have no proof of ownership, she said the couple had paid €20,000, about $24,300, to buy their derelict home from its previous occupant.“Of course I knew that we were buying something illegal here, but how many people far richer than me now have a lovely house for which they never got a proper permit?” Ms. Carbonell Escudero said. “In Spain, if you wait long enough, what was illegal can become legal.”Eugenio García-Calderón, an engineer who previously provided solar energy to people in the Brazilian Amazon, said he had come to Cañada Real after its power was cut. The inflow of emergency aid was welcome, he said, but “nothing good can really happen here until we have a sustainable model, something that makes people self-sufficient rather than reliant on outside help.”</body>

	<title>I Can’t Believe I Need to Say This, but We Need Schools More Than Bars</title>
	<author>Vanessa Barbara</author>
	<body>SÃO PAULO, Brazil — For almost 10 months now, around 35 million Brazilian children have been out of school. When schools were closed in March, at the beginning of the pandemic, I thought we only had to be a little patient. As soon as we got the virus under control, they would be the first to reopen, right?Wrong. Brazil hasn’t come close to controlling the pandemic: In the absence of national lockdowns and comprehensive mass testing, the daily death toll has remained constantly high. The most we got — beyond President Jair Bolsonaro’s brazen denials that anything was wrong — were a few restrictions applied here and there by local governments.Then as early as June, regional governors — hoping to mitigate the bleakness of the situation — thought it a good idea to slowly reopen the institutions that were most important to us: shopping centers, restaurants, bars, gyms, beauty salons, movie theaters, concert halls, even betting shops. Pretty much everything, it seemed, except for schools. And so it has mostly stayed.On public health grounds, this made no sense. As people resumed their cardio workouts and hair-dying habits, the virus continued to spread. And in response, teachers refused to return to schools while the risks were so high. (I don’t blame them.) But surely our leaders wouldn’t just cast children aside — they would have a plan for a gradual reopening, right?Wrong again! Ten months since schools were shuttered, everything is roughly as it was. In Brazil, bizarrely, bars have been deemed more important than schools, manicures of greater social significance than children’s mental health. Most parents feel abandoned, forced to take on an intolerable burden with no support. And an entire generation of children, their development dangerously stalled, have been left to their own devices.The results have been dreadful. Many Brazilian students are currently receiving some version of remote learning — but only those who have the means to do so. Roughly 25 percent of students from public schools don’t have access to the internet, according to one estimate. Other research found that close to a third of caregivers were concerned that their kids would drop out of school altogether.That’s not surprising. It’s hard to overemphasize the positive impact of in-person learning, which goes far beyond reading and writing to include children’s physical and mental health, nutrition, safety and social skills. In its absence, pediatricians have reported a worrying rise in depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and aggressive behavior among their patients.And in a country as unequal as ours, this interruption is especially devastating. While in many cities private schools, sufficiently solvent to adapt their buildings, have been authorized to partially reopen for in-person classes, public schools — often, like the nursery my 2-year-old attended until March, small, unventilated and crowded — have mostly remained closed. The poorer the child, the greater the damage of school closure. (In more ways than one: At least seven million children could be going hungry at home, without access to school lunches.)All in all, according to a November report by the UNICEF, children in Latin America and the Caribbean have lost on average four times more days of schooling compared with the rest of the world. Most students are now at risk of missing out on an entire school year. For younger children, most affected by the lack of socialization, it’s an especially big blow. There simply aren’t enough studies to measure the size of the educational catastrophe we’re facing here.I wish I had an easy solution for this tragedy, for the sake of our children. (Hey! What about turning all the bars into schools? Just picture it: teachers instead of waiters, children at the tables. We could put milk in beer kegs!) But there’s no straightforward fix. Though many scientific studies show that children don’t appear to be exposed to higher risks of coronavirus infection in schools and that school staff, compared with the general adult population, aren’t at a higher risk either, that depends on having community transmission rates under control and mitigation measures in place.But in Brazil, where the second wave has crashed on the top of the first one — on Jan. 7, the country reached the mark of 200,000 Covid-19 deaths — and schools often lack the basic infrastructure to institute public health measures, those conditions are clearly not present.Some governors and mayors recently announced their intention to open schools in February or March, no matter what. But teachers are now refusing to go back to in-person classes until they are vaccinated. The trouble is Brazil still doesn’t have a solid national immunization plan. Judging from the chaotic, inchoate rollout so far, amid the appearance of two new variants of the virus, it could take months to vaccinate all school workers.But doing nothing is not an option. So here are three suggestions. First, we need — right away — to increase public school funding and put in place a comprehensive plan to reform school buildings. (Many Brazilian cities could actually set up open-air schools all year long; we live in a tropical country, after all.) Second, we need to give teachers and school staff early access to vaccination, once frontline health personnel and high-risk populations are vaccinated.And third, we need to do something especially courageous: We should call for the closure of all nonessential services until schools are safe enough to reopen. It might not be immediately popular — people may miss their foot baths to the point of anguish — but for the well-being and future of our country’s children, it is essential.There is an alternative, of course. Kids will have to expropriate all bars. And beauty salons. And betting shops.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Google to lend its facilities for use as vaccine clinics.</title>
	<author>Daisuke Wakabayashi</author>
	<body>Google said it will make company buildings, parking lots and open spaces available to serve as temporary vaccination clinics in partnership with health care providers and public health officials.In a blog post on Monday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said the company will start by opening sites in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City, with plans to expand to other sites nationwide.The move is part of a series of measures to help accelerate vaccination efforts. Google also said it plans to contribute $100 million in ad credits to health organizations to educate people about the vaccine and $50 million for groups working on fair access to the vaccine.It will also include more information in search results and maps to help people find vaccination locations with details about who is eligible and whether appointments are necessary. Google said it will provide local distribution information in search results in the coming week so people can determine whether they are eligible to receive a vaccine.</body>

	<title>Yes, You Still Need to Wear a Mask</title>
	<author>Jane E. Brody</author>
	<body>As a professional health writer and concerned citizen, the ache in my heart deepens with each new report of the devastation wrought by the novel coronavirus, the cause of immeasurable — and still increasing — personal and economic pain for people caught in its deadly spikes.In a recent five-week period, 100,000 Americans died from complications of Covid-19, a toll that took the country four months to reach last spring.My distress is magnified by the knowledge that it didn’t have to be this bad. One simple measure — consistent wearing of face coverings in public — could have helped to stem the agony. In December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reiterated advice first given in July: “Wear a mask over your nose and mouth. Everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don’t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”Masks, the agency emphasized, protect both the wearer and those the wearer encounters in the course of daily life.Now, with the emergence of a highly contagious variant of the virus and the chaotic attempts to distribute and administer vaccines to hundreds of millions of vulnerable Americans, short of a total lockdown, universal mask-wearing is the most effective way to slow the relentless rise in hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19.It will take many months to immunize everyone willing and able to get a Covid vaccine. Meanwhile, we’re facing another tsunami of deadly coronavirus infections as the new variant sweeps through swaths of still-unprotected millions.As with many other measures not taken by the last administration to minimize the spread of Covid-19, mask-wearing was left up to the states to mandate and enforce. Masks became a political football, and the former president publicly ridiculed opponents who wore them. Some elected officials even made the ridiculous, baseless claim that masks not only don’t thwart the spread of the virus, they actually enhance it. I wonder if they also ignored parents and teachers who told them to cover their mouths when they coughed or sneezed.I also wonder about the economic savvy of our former president and the governors who have resisted issuing mask mandates, some of whom got Covid-19 themselves yet clamored to open the economy. Goldman Sachs estimated last June that implementing a nationwide mask mandate could have a potential impact on the U.S. GDP of one trillion dollars.Lately, as I await my second vaccine shot, I’ve become increasingly aware of how many people walk, run or cycle without a mask or, if they have a mask, wear it ineffectively. I’ve taken to speaking up more often: “Please wear your mask” or “The mask should cover your nose and mouth.” Among the ignorant responses: “I don’t need a mask when I’m outside,” “I already had Covid so I can’t get it again or give it to you,” and my favorite while walking on a four-foot-wide path, “I stay six feet away from people.”Although six-foot social distancing is not totally arbitrary, it’s based on limited evidence among airline passengers and may not apply at all, for example, to the unmasked cyclists shouting to one another as they ride past me or to the heavy-breathing runners I pass.I’ve also heard a few people say, “I already got the vaccine, so I don’t need a mask.” This may be the most dangerous excuse of all. First, although the vaccines are very good, they’re not perfect, and chances are these vaccine recipients haven’t been checked for strong antibodies to the virus. Second, we don’t yet know if the vaccines, while highly effective in preventing sickness and death, will also prevent asymptomatic infection that can spread the virus to others.As Jeremy Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco, said of mask refusers: “How would you feel if you made your best friend sick, or killed your friend’s mother?”Last February, after the World Health Organization, with no supporting data, advised against wearing a mask unless you were already sick, Mr. Howard amassed an international team of 19 scientists to review the evidence for mask-wearing, expecting to find “that masks were a waste of time,” he said in an interview. Instead, he said, the team found that “the data on the benefit of masks is really compelling.” The results of their exhaustive study were published recently in PNAS, the peer-reviewed Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Mr. Howard said that preliminary reports of their findings resulted “in all sorts of abuse, including death threats” from mask resisters. But that has not kept him from repeating that “wearing any kind of mask will greatly help to keep you from accidentally infecting others, which is important for the community and the economy. About half of coronavirus infections are spread by people who don’t know they’re sick, and the new variant is much more transmissible.”A Chinese study found that the viral load in the upper respiratory tracts of infected people without symptoms can be just as high as those with symptoms, and simply talking and breathing can spread virus-laden droplets and aerosols. And because the virus resides in high amounts in the nose and throat, sneezing can spew an infectious cloud 10 or more times further than coughing.Which brings me to the question of whether the face coverings most people use are sufficiently protective. I now know that the bandannas, exam masks and the slim neoprene masks I’ve been using for the last 11 months are better than nothing but not very good. They provide too many routes for virus-carrying particles to reach an unsuspecting nose or mouth.I should have followed the advice my colleague Tara Parker-Pope offered months ago on upgrading your mask.“Masks,” Mr. Howard said, “need a nose wire to provide a close fit and proper filtration material, like a nanofiber, that filters very small particles.”He and his co-authors concluded that for most of us, KN95 masks, especially those with bands that fit around the head, are currently the best to prevent contracting and spreading the virus.Another option is the KF94 mask or, if it’s not too uncomfortable, doubling up on masks for added protection.KN95 masks meet foreign certification standards and are designed to filter out 95 percent of particles down to 0.3 microns in size. (The gold standard N95 masks, which meet U.S. certification standards, should be reserved for health care and emergency personnel who are most likely to interact with Covid-infected individuals.)Powecom KN95 masks have an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. I just ordered a packet of 11 on Amazon for $23.80 and I expect to be using them for many months after I’m vaccine-protected. I might still be able to transmit the virus and I want to set a good example for my fellow citizens.</body>

	<title>Morgan Wallen Repeats at No. 1 With Big Streaming Numbers</title>
	<author>Ben Sisario</author>
	<body>The country singer Morgan Wallen holds at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart for a second time with his streaming hit “Dangerous: The Double Album,” topping a slow week for music sales.“Dangerous,” which has 30 songs, notched the equivalent of 159,000 sales in the United States, down 40 percent from its opening, according to MRC Data, the tracking service formerly known as Nielsen Music. The album’s total includes 177 million streams and 22,000 copies sold as a full package. Even with those reduced numbers, “Dangerous” had by far more streams in a week than any country album has had before.“Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon” by the New York rapper Pop Smoke, who died last February at age 20, is in second place, continuing its remarkable chart run. In the 29 weeks since the album came out in July, it has stayed in the Top 10 for every week but one, when it dipped to No. 11 at the end of last year; for much of that time, it has stayed comfortably in the Top 5.Why Don’t We, a boy band, opened at No. 3 with “The Good Times and the Bad Ones,” with the equivalent of 46,000 sales. Taylor Swift’s “Evermore” is No. 4 in its sixth week out, and Ariana Grande’s “Positions” is No. 5.Last week’s top single, Olivia Rodrigo’s smash “Drivers License,” holds at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.</body>

	<title>Andrés Manuel López Obrador ya extraña a Donald Trump, a quien alguna vez criticó</title>
	<author>Natalie Kitroeff</author>
	<body>CIUDAD DE MÉXICO — El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, llamó a los mexicanos violadores, amenazó al país con una guerra comercial, expulsó a decenas de miles de solicitantes de asilo, hizo que México los alojara en campamentos, construyó el muro fronterizo y le dijo a México que lo pagara.El presidente de México es un gran admirador.Tan profundo es su aprecio que cuando el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador finalmente se puso al teléfono por primera vez con el presidente electo Joe Biden el mes pasado, se aseguró de elogiar al presidente saliente.“Debo mencionar que tenemos una muy buena relación con el ahora presidente de su país, el señor Donald Trump”, dijo López Obrador, según dos personas enteradas sobre la llamada, y que hablaron con condición de anonimato para discutir asuntos internos. “Independientemente de cualquier otra consideración, él respeta nuestra soberanía”.Preocupado porque Biden esté más inclinado a entrometerse en los asuntos mexicanos, López Obrador ha pasado las últimas semanas, de forma preventiva, incomodando al gobierno entrante.López Obrador fue uno de los últimos líderes mundiales en felicitar a Biden por su victoria, insistiendo en esperar “hasta que se resuelvan todos los asuntos legales”. Recientemente firmó una ley que limitó de manera significativa la actuación de los agentes de drogas de Estados Unidos para actuar en México. Y luego, de la nada, le ofreció asilo a Julian Assange.Su gobierno también exoneró a un exsecretario de Defensa mexicano acusado de tráfico de drogas por fiscales estadounidenses, acusaciones que el presidente dijo que se habían “fabricado” por investigadores que “no actuaron con profesionalismo”.Detrás de todos esos desaires está el temor de que los demócratas sean más propensos a intervenir para promover los derechos laborales y la energía limpia, obstaculizando la ambiciosa agenda nacional de López Obrador, según dos funcionarios de su gobierno que hablaron bajo la condición de anonimato por temor a represalias.“Es como un perro en el parque: está mostrando los dientes y amenazándote y gruñendo con la esperanza de que no te acerques”, dijo Shannon O’Neil, una experta en México del Consejo de Relaciones Exteriores. “Está intentando rechazar de forma preventiva la participación del próximo gobierno de Biden”.En un comunicado, Roberto Velasco, director general para América del Norte de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores de México, dijo que el gobierno había sostenido varias conversaciones con el equipo de transición de Biden en las que se había “subrayado la importancia que ambas partes dan a una buena relación bilateral”.Velasco añadió: “México seguirá trabajando, de acuerdo con nuestros principios constitucionales, para fomentar la mejor relación entre nuestro país y Estados Unidos. Quienes continúan pronosticando conflictos bilaterales otra vez estarán equivocados”.Uno de los sorprendentes giros en una presidencia de Trump llena de ellos ha sido cómo un líder mexicano que hizo campaña con una plataforma populista de izquierda y que alguna vez dijo que Trump “azuza el racismo”, llegó a tenerle tanto aprecio.Todas las apariencias apuntan a que la relación se basa más en el pragmatismo que en una amistad personal cercana. Los dos hombres comparten un profundo desinterés por los detalles de la política exterior y encontraron un propósito común en dejarse en paz el uno al otro.Aunque los términos de su acuerdo pueden haber sido tácitos, eran claros. López Obrador hizo cumplir la agenda de inmigración de línea dura de Trump y, a cambio, Estados Unidos le permitió dirigir México a su antojo.En su reciente discurso en Alamo, Texas, Trump se jactó de cuántos soldados mexicanos había enviado López Obrador para vigilar la frontera. “Quiero agradecer al gran presidente de México. Es un gran caballero, un amigo mío”, dijo Trump.En cuanto al estilo, también, los líderes se alineaban a menudo. Ambos hicieron campaña con la promesa de erradicar a una élite corrupta, ganaron con una coalición de votantes disgustados con la clase dominante de su país y, una vez en el cargo, pintaron a los medios de comunicación y a la oposición como enemigos de su movimiento.Así como Trump usó Twitter para hablar directamente con su base, López Obrador toma el control del discurso al celebrar conferencias de prensa de dos horas diariamente, en las que muchas de las preguntas son hechas por reporteros de tabloides simpatizantes o YouTubers.Y, en 2006, López Obrador pasó meses formulando acusaciones de fraude después de perder las elecciones presidenciales, llegando incluso a celebrar una falsa toma de protesta en la plaza central de la capital.“En cierto sentido, se parece mucho a Trump”, dijo Sergio Aguayo, uno de los principales activistas de los derechos humanos de México. “El entendimiento entre ambos fue emocional y práctico”.Es probable que Biden le pida más a López Obrador.El presidente electo prevé un aumento de la migración desde América Latina en el próximo año, impulsado por la crisis económica mundial y la percepción de que habrá un oído más comprensivo en la Casa Blanca, según varias personas familiarizadas con su pensamiento. El domingo, los soldados guatemaltecos rechazaron una caravana de miles de centroamericanos que viajaban hacia el norte desde Honduras con la esperanza de llegar a Estados Unidos.México, que movilizó fuerzas de seguridad adicionales en su frontera sur en preparación para esta última caravana, se considera crucial para frenar las nuevas oleadas de migrantes. Y con la pandemia aún en curso, el gobierno de Biden también necesitará la cooperación de López Obrador para instituir más pruebas de detección y rastreo de coronavirus para quienes cruzan la frontera sur.Pero es poco probable que Biden recurra a las amenazas o a la humillación pública para conseguir que México haga lo que quiere, dando a López Obrador una oportunidad para tratar de establecer el tono de una relación más distante desde el principio.Si bien el presidente mexicano dice que quiere mantener “una política de buena vecindad” con la superpotencia en la frontera, también ha criticado a sus predecesores por ser “hasta serviles y muy irresponsables en cuanto a hacer valer nuestra soberanía”.En el reciente encontronazo sobre la decisión de México de no presentar cargos contra un exsecretario de Defensa al que Estados Unidos acusa de trabajar para un cártel de la droga, López Obrador se ha defendido arremetiendo contra los funcionarios estadounidenses. Los acusó de llevar a cabo “una investigación así sin sustento, sin pruebas”.Su verdadero objetivo, según los analistas, puede ser avivar un profundo resentimiento del público mexicano hacia la intervención estadounidense en la guerra contra las drogas.“Está tratando de activar una cierta racha antiestadounidense”, dijo Carlos Bravo Regidor, analista político y profesor asociado del CIDE, una universidad mexicana. Si tiene éxito, será más fácil rechazar la influencia de EE.UU. sobre su gobierno.“Van a presionar a López Obrador para que cambie ciertas políticas”, dijo Bravo, “y López Obrador va a decir: ‘¿Ves? Están tratando de intervenir en nuestros asuntos internos. Y no lo vamos a permitir’”.</body>

	<title>What if you never get better from Covid-19?</title>
	<author>Moises Velasquez-Manoff</author>
	<body>When Mount Sinai Hospital opened its Center for Post-Covid Care in May, it was the first such facility in the United States. The doctors there expected to treat patients who had been severely ill or hospitalized. By that point, three months into the pandemic, they knew that the coronavirus could cause harm to many parts of the body beyond the airways where infections most commonly begin. And they knew that medical treatments meant to save patients’ lives could also take a toll. Recovery from having been put on a ventilator, in particular, could be a lengthy process.Mount Sinai sought to support patients recovering from severe Covid-19 by giving them access to a multidisciplinary medical team that included lung, heart and kidney doctors, rehabilitation specialists and psychiatrists for those whose mental health might have been affected by their ordeals.Hundreds of patients, most of them women, showed up soon after the center’s doors opened. To the doctors’ surprise, however, many of them had experienced only mild cases of Covid-19. They hadn’t been hospitalized. They were relatively young and otherwise in good health, without the underlying conditions like obesity and diabetes that are known to make Covid-19 worse.And yet, months after their bodies had seemingly fought off the coronavirus, they still felt quite ill. “We’ve heard of illnesses, viral illnesses, that have a prolonged postviral phase,” said Dr. Zijian Chen, the head of Mount Sinai’s recovery center. “But these usually don’t last for the months and months that we see here. And because of that, we’re a little surprised that this is happening. It tells us how much we don’t know about this illness.” The center has now seen more than 1,600 patients.These patients have labeled themselves “Covid long-haulers.” As a group, they report a strange hodgepodge of symptoms, including fatigue, pain, shortness of breath, light sensitivity, exercise intolerance, insomnia, hearts that race inexplicably, diarrhea and cramping, memory problems and a debilitating “brain fog” that can at times make it hard to put a cogent sentence together.</body>

	<title>Alex Padilla, California’s First Latino Senator, on Needing to ‘Walk and Chew Gum’ in Washington</title>
	<author>Jennifer Medina</author>
	<body>LOS ANGELES — As Kamala Harris steps into her role as vice president and out of her Senate office this week, the Democrat Alex Padilla will become the first Latino senator from California, a state where Latino residents make up 40 percent of the population, and will be one of six in the Senate. Mr. Padilla, who has been California’s secretary of state since 2015, is heading to Washington at a time when the country — and California — is deeply mired in the pandemic and a sluggish vaccine rollout. His own political career began with immigration activism, and he believes that the country needs a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants. He said he was confident that the Senate would be able to focus on an impeachment trial and the pressing need to get the pandemic under control — “we will walk and chew gum at the same time.”These are lightly edited excerpts from the conversation.California is roughly 40 percent Latino, yet you’re the first Latino senator from the state. Why do you think that took so long? What does it say about California and the political influence of Latinos?I don’t know if I have a 170-year answer to that question, but it’s a big moment for the Latino community in California.  I’m sure there’s a lot of researchers and academics with various theories. I just know that it has just added to the sense of urgency with which I’m prepared to tackle the job.A lot of big issues need attention — increasing access to health care, combating climate change, a comprehensive immigration reform, closing the education gap. But for the time being, it’s all through the lens of Covid, in recognition of the devastation the damage has caused for far too many families, far too many communities, especially Latino communities and other communities of color.Let’s talk about the pandemic. Los Angeles is currently an epicenter of the pandemic, and Pacoima, the neighborhood you grew up in, is an epicenter of that epicenter. What can the Senate do about that?That’s a great example of the people who say, well, you know, don’t take stuff too personally. Well, I can’t help but take it personally. My dad lives there and we’ve managed to keep him safe and healthy since March. But I think about his safety every single day.From the beginning, communities of color, the essential workers, which Latinos disproportionately make up, are at increased risk because of the nature of their work. We’re contracting it, and it impacts us disproportionately compared to other communities. And that’s what’s playing out right now. I just wish so many more governors had taken the bold, aggressive action that our governor did. We were able to keep the numbers relatively lower per capita for a good chunk of 2020, compared to other states, including neighboring Arizona. Here’s what breaks my heart. You know you catch the morning news and hear about record Dow Jones. But if you go to the Covid testing sites or the food banks, you see longer and longer lines. That contrast is heartbreaking.I know Gov. Gavin Newsom is a longtime ally and he just appointed you. But given the infection rates here, and the slow vaccine rollout, it seems like a strange time to praise him. Do you really think he’s doing a good job right now?I think he’s been dealt a tough hand by the Trump administration. Clearly there will be a next phase of the vaccine, but it’s really hard to plan for the next phase of the vaccine rollout when you don’t know when the next batch of vaccines are coming. I know Donald Trump is not up for this. His failure or refusal to lead from Day 1 of the pandemic is what has caused this mess across the country.Democrats are going to have an extremely packed agenda — do you think impeachment will impede on that? Do you want to see a trial in the Senate?It may make for longer workdays or for longer workweeks, but we have to prioritize Covid response and uphold our democracy and accountability, accountability and accountability. Nobody is above the law. That’s what the American people believe. And they deserve a Congress that’s going to act on that.So there’s no question in your mind you want to see action on that?Absolutely. And as I talk to more and more of my colleagues to be, I hear loud and clear as we can and we will walk and chew gum at the same time. We have to.Your own political career came out of your immigration activism. I’ve talked to a lot of current immigration activists who are very skeptical about whether the Biden administration will make the kinds of sweeping changes they want to see. Do you share any of that skepticism?No state has more at stake in that debate than this one. Look, I am optimistic, but I know full well that it’s going to take a lot of work and I’m eager to get to that work. I think we need normalization and a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants in the nation. A good chunk of the essential work force that we’ve been praising since the beginning of the pandemic is undocumented. It is not enough to just reverse executive orders signed by Donald Trump. We have to go beyond that and actually provide the comprehensive immigration reform. So it may be hard, but I know it’s possible we have to rebuild the asylum system at the border, among other things. Let’s tackle the wait times of the naturalization process for eligible citizens today.How worried are you about the future of elections? Do the doubts that the president and other Republicans have sowed undermine democracy?The doubt is a huge danger and it’s not just a potential danger. We saw the fatal consequences of having a conspiracy theorist with a bullhorn sitting in the Oval Office. Buteven with the departure of Trump, we have a lot of work to do before the next election. Misinformation, disinformation is extremely dangerous. We’re already seeing it play out in vaccine distribution and lack of confidence in certain communities of the vaccine and therefore an unwillingness maybe to take it sooner rather than later.President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. campaigned on unity, and I expect that will be a theme of his speech on Wednesday. How optimistic are you or not that unity is something that can happen in our country, given the last four years and the last few weeks?Unity is very, very much a value. You know, we’re not going to reach utopia in one day or one week or even one year. But it’s going to be something that we strive for. I hope it manifests itself in the working environment in the halls of Congress. But it’s also important to happen in living rooms and eventually diners and barbershops across America.The Democrats have a slight edge in the Senate. Do you think that means there will be more ambitious action, more ambitious legislation?I certainly hope so. Look it, we’ve got to think big. That’s going to be my sentiment. Even without the pandemic of this last year, in addition to the health and economic devastation that Covid has wreaked on a lot of communities, it’s also exacerbated a lot of the underlying disparities, which really need to be addressed. Education, for example, with so many young people learning, trying to learn remotely, it’s brought back concerns about the digital divide, whether it’s with access to broadband or digital literacy, even the affordability of devices. So there was an education gap prior to the pandemic and evidence shows that it’s exacerbated by the pandemic. That’s just one example.Where do you put yourself on the political spectrum? Do you expect to be sort of on the more progressive end of the caucus, or do you consider yourself a moderate?I’m eager to arrive in the Senate and begin pushing the envelope.</body>

	<title>In farewell video, Melania Trump, who like her husband bristled at White House norms, defends her legacy.</title>
	<author>Katie Rogers</author>
	<body>Melania Trump defended her legacy as first lady in a video posted on Monday, asked Americans to “lead by example” in caring for others, and name-checked her Be Best platform, which over the years never grew into a comprehensible policy effort.“Use every opportunity to show consideration for another person,” Mrs. Trump said in the video, which was labeled a farewell. “In all circumstances, I ask every American to be an ambassador of Be Best. To focus on what unites us, to raise above what divides us, to always choose love over hatred, peace over violence, and others above yourself.”Mrs. Trump’s last message as first lady was like so many that have come before: It was completely at odds with the behavior of her husband, President Trump, who was impeached last week for a second time for his role in inciting a violent riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6.“As I say farewell to my role as first lady, it is my sincere hope that every American will do their part to teach our children what it means to be best,” Mrs. Trump said.Over the past few days, Mrs. Trump has posted several farewell messages detailing her work in the White House, and asking Americans to be kind to one another. Last week, as the nation reeled from the aftermath of the Capitol riot, Mrs. Trump used her platform to lament that gossip had been spread about her — most likely a nod to a former aide, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who recently published an unflattering tell-all about their relationship.In the end, Mrs. Trump’s most lasting contributions could likely be the aesthetic changes she oversaw, updates meant to make life in the White House more functional for the first family and their visitors over the visiting public.In a message posted to the White House website on Monday, Mrs. Trump said that during her time at the White House, she ordered the restoration of an elevator, the repair of wallpaper in the Family Dining Room, and — in the midst of the pandemic — the revamping of the White House Rose Garden.The goal, Mrs. Trump said, was to “balance the needs of the present with the continuity of overall architectural tradition of the White House.”Though she demonstrated a respect for the historic nature of her home for the past four years, Mrs. Trump paid little attention to traditions that did not interest her.She is currently without a chief of staff, a social secretary or a press secretary. Junior White House aides have scripted her farewell messages. And she has not reached out to the incoming first lady, Jill Biden, about transition matters. There are no plans for that to change before Inauguration Day.It is customary for incoming and outgoing first ladies to meet for a tour of the White House, but on Monday, a person familiar with Dr. Biden’s thinking said that since Mr. Trump had still not conceded to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. it would not make sense for the two to meet.That person added that Dr. Biden knew her way around, anyway.</body>

	<title>Jeffrey Clark Was Considered Unassuming. Then He Plotted With Trump.</title>
	<author>Charlie Savage</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — It was New Year’s Eve, but the Justice Department’s top leaders had little to celebrate as they discussed Jeffrey Clark, the acting head of the civil division, who had repeatedly pushed them to help President Donald J. Trump undo his electoral loss.Huddled in the department’s headquarters, they noted that they had rebuked him for secretly meeting with Mr. Trump, even as the department had rebuffed the president’s outlandish requests for court filings and special counsels, according to six people with knowledge of the meeting. No official would host a news conference to say that federal fraud investigations cast the results in doubt, they told him. No one would send a letter making such claims to Georgia lawmakers.When the meeting ended not long before midnight, Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen hoped that the matter was settled, never suspecting that his subordinate would secretly discuss the plan for the letter with Mr. Trump, and very nearly take Mr. Rosen’s job, as part of a plot with the president to wield the department’s power to try to alter the Georgia election outcome.It was clear that night, though, that Mr. Clark — with his willingness to entertain conspiracy theories about voting booth hacks and election fraud — was not the establishment lawyer they thought him to be. Some senior department leaders had considered him quiet, hard-working and detail-oriented. Others said they knew nothing about him, so low was his profile. He struck neither his fans in the department nor his detractors as being part of the Trumpist faction of the party, according to interviews.The department’s senior leaders were shocked when Mr. Clark’s machinations came to light. They have spent recent weeks debating how he came to betray Mr. Rosen, his biggest champion at the department, and what blend of ambition and conviction led him to reject the results of the election and embrace Mr. Trump’s claims, despite all evidence to the contrary, including inside the department itself.The plot devised by Mr. Clark and Mr. Trump would have ousted Mr. Rosen and used the Justice Department to pressure lawmakers in Georgia to overturn the state’s election results. But Mr. Trump ultimately decided against firing Mr. Rosen after top department leaders pledged to resign en masse.Mr. Clark declined to comment for this report, but he reiterated his assertion that The New York Times’s account of his conversations with Mr. Trump, first reported on Friday, and his colleagues was inaccurate. He said he could not detail those inaccuracies because of legal privilege issues. And he said all of his official communications “were consistent with law.”Some of his friends said that those who told the press about his final days at the Justice Department painted a picture of a man they do not recognize. “The story kind of shocked me because this is not the Jeff that I know,” said Theodore H. Frank, a friend and former colleague. “I know Jeff as a guy who really cares about the rule of law and, you know, just a rumpled, thoughtful lawyer who is an intellectual — not a Machiavellian backstabber.”Mr. Clark had spent two years leading the Justice Department’s environmental division, where he was seen as a standard Republican lawyer political appointee — a member of the conservative Federalist Society with a skepticism of rules that cut into corporate profits.But now, Mr. Clark, 53, has become notorious. A person who has worked closely with Kirkland &amp; Ellis, where Mr. Clark spent most of his career outside two stints in the George W. Bush and Trump Justice Departments, said there appeared to be scant chance that the law firm would rehire him.Friends and critics alike reject the notion that Mr. Clark is an operator, describing him as “nerdy” and “thoughtful.”Mr. Frank, who met Mr. Clark when both worked at Kirkland &amp; Ellis in the 1990s and described himself as a Federalist Society member who voted for President Biden, said he was reserving judgment about the incident. Others were more direct.“This is the first wave of character assassination, of people going after the most effective lawyers in the Trump administration,” said Mandy Gunasekara, who worked with Mr. Clark when she worked at the Environmental Protection Agency in the clean air division and as chief of staff to Andrew R. Wheeler when he was the agency’s administrator. She was struck by the fact that Mr. Clark’s colleagues were so upset and fixated on an event that ultimately did not happen. Mr. Trump, after all, did not  replace Mr. Rosen with Mr. Clark or have the Justice Department contact Georgia lawmakers.She said Mr. Clark was most likely discussing with his colleagues and the president “a range of options,” just as he was known for doing in his work advising her agency.Some of Mr. Clark’s associates said he could be pedantic. As a manager, he made no effort to hide when he had little respect for his career subordinates’ opinions.He is not known for being understated on the topic of himself. Where the typical biography on the Justice Department website runs a few paragraphs, Mr. Clark’s includes the elementary school he attended in Philadelphia, a topic he debated in college and that he worked for his college newspaper, The Harvard Crimson.After graduating from Harvard in 1989, Mr. Clark earned a master’s degree in urban affairs and public policy from the Biden School of Public Policy at the University of Delaware in 1993 and a law degree from Georgetown University in 1995. He clerked for an appeals court judge, Danny Boggs, who was known for giving prospective clerks quizzes that tested not just their knowledge of the law, but also a range of esoteric trivia.Numerous inquiries. Since former President Donald Trump left office, there have been many investigations and inquiries into his businesses and personal affairs. Here’s a list of those ongoing:Investigation into criminal fraud. The Manhattan district attorney’s office and the New York attorney general’s office have been investigating whether Mr. Trump or his family business, the Trump Organization, intentionally submitted false property values to potential lenders. In February, two Manhattan prosecutors resigned, clouding the future of the district attorney’s case.Investigation into tax evasion. As part of their investigation, in July 2021, the Manhattan district attorney’s office charged the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its chief financial officer, with orchestrating a 15-year scheme to evade taxes. In February, lawyers for both parties asked a judge to dismiss the charges.Investigation into election interference. The Atlanta district attorney is conducting a criminal investigation of election interference in Georgia by Mr. Trump and his allies.Investigation into the Trump National Golf Club. Prosecutors in the district attorney’s office in Westchester County, N.Y., appear to be focused at least in part on whether the Trump Organization misled local officials about the property’s value to reduce its taxes.Civil investigation into Trump Organization. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, is seeking to question Mr. Trump under oath in a civil fraud investigation of his business practices.Mr. Clark then worked for Kirkland &amp; Ellis from 1996 to 2001, followed by a stint in the Justice Department’s environmental and natural resources division during the Bush administration, before returning to Kirkland in 2005 as a partner, but not one with an equity stake in the firm, according to a person who worked closely with him at the law firm.He held the title of “non-equity partner,” which meant that he did not share in the firm’s profits or make leadership decisions.When Mr. Clark returned to the Justice Department as the head of the environmental division in 2018, he flew under the radar. Like other Republican officials, he narrowly interpreted the division’s legal authority and had a typically tense relationship with career lawyers when it came to enforcing anti-pollution laws.In one instance, Mr. Clark held up Clean Water Act enforcement cases because of a pending matter before the Supreme Court that career lawyers felt did not directly relate to their work, according to a lawyer with knowledge of those cases. The Supreme Court was hearing a matter that involved discharges that flowed through groundwater before reaching waters regulated by the federal government, and the department was working on a case that involved flows over land.His employees believed that Mr. Clark hoped the court would curtail the law’s reach in a way that would apply to overland spills, too,  but by a 6-to-3 ruling, it did not.In a different case, he disagreed with a recommendation that the civil division made to the Office of the Solicitor General, and ultimately got his way after asking the general counsels of other agencies to also push back on the recommendation. Civil division employees said he did not tell them that he would do this, and felt that had circumvented the proper process.While Mr. Clark oversaw environmental cases, sometimes working late into the night and personally reviewing briefs, the department’s civil division was in turmoil. Its leader, Jody Hunt, sometimes clashed with the White House Counsel’s Office and, later on, with Attorney General William P. Barr, over how best to defend the administration.Mr. Hunt resigned with no warning in July, leaving his deputy to run the division while Mr. Barr and Mr. Rosen searched for an acting leader among the department’s thinned-out ranks. Mr. Clark wanted the job, which was a considerable step up in stature, and Mr. Rosen supported the idea even though he was already a division head, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.After he took the helm of the civil division in September, colleagues began seeing flashes of unusual behavior. Mr. Clark’s name appeared on eyebrow-raising briefs, including what would turn out to be an unsuccessful effort to inject the government into a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump by a woman who has said he raped her more than two decades ago. He also signed onto an attempt to use the Justice Department to sue a former friend of the first lady at the time, Melania Trump, for writing a tell-all memoir.He made clear to lawyers who produced draft briefs that they must spell out his name in full, Jeffrey Bossert Clark, according to a former official.Others said he mounted an idiosyncratic push to remove the word “acting” from his official title — acting assistant attorney general of the civil division — citing an old department legal opinion from the 1980s. Officials denied his request.</body>

	<title>What Is Happening With the Virus in California? For Now, Many Mixed Signals</title>
	<author>Jill Cowan</author>
	<body>(This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up to get it delivered to your inbox.)Good morning.If you’re confused about the state of the virus in California, you’re not alone.While California’s overall case numbers have been on the decline, hospitals in Southern California are still overwhelmed and experts worry that new variants of the virus — including one that researchers recently found in more than half of samples collected in Los Angeles — could threaten progress curbing Covid-19’s rampant spread.[Compare coronavirus case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths across California with this map.]In the Bay Area, intensive care unit capacity has risen to 23.4 percent, according to the state as of Sunday — well above the 15 percent threshold that triggered the stay-at-home order for the region. Yet the Sacramento area has just 11.9 percent intensive care unit capacity, and was allowed to exit the strict order more than a week ago.Although The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Saturday that officials in the region were feeling hopeful that the order would be lifted soon, the state’s department of public health reported on Sunday that the Bay Area wasn’t eligible to have restrictions loosened based on its projections.[See how full hospital intensive care units are near you.]Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to make an announcement about lifting some restrictions in the state on Monday.The Associated Press reported that Mr. Newsom’s administration has refused to disclose key data that would help explain the difference in approaches between the Bay Area and Sacramento.In any case, the state hinted in a news release on Sunday that Sacramento may be required to re-enter the stay-at-home order, which would force many businesses to shut back down. (We can expect to get an update from state officials in coming days.)And even after President Biden unveiled what experts have long said is a desperately needed national strategy for finally controlling the pandemic, there are still major hurdles in the vaccine rollout, which in California has contributed to continuing chaos, in which vaccine eligibility rules have been implemented differently county by county.As CalMatters reported, the state quietly rolled out a promised clearinghouse website to help people find vaccination appointments. But it’s still a work in progress.[Track the vaccine rollout in California and other states.]Read more:One of the biggest contributors to Los Angeles County’s surge is its overcrowded housing. [The New York Times]Mandatory masking for interstate travel. Ramped up manufacturing. Here’s more of what’s in President Biden’s pandemic executive orders. [The New York Times]Experts believe as many as thousands of coronavirus deaths have not been counted in San Bernardino County, giving a false sense of the disease’s deadliness. [The Riverside Press-Enterprise]Fear over testing positive for Covid-19 and not being able to return to work, as well as worries over the vaccines, are hurting the eastern Coachella Valley. [The Desert Sun]A coalition of more than 50 Bay Area restaurants and wineries sued Governor Newsom over the state’s outdoor dining ban. [The San Francisco Chronicle]Getting millions of people vaccinated will help reduce infections. But vaccines alone won’t end the pandemic. [The New York Times]The governor’s $2 billion school reopening fund could actually cost districts money. [CalMatters]Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced a civil rights investigation into the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, a huge agency wracked by allegations of overuse of force and deputy misconduct. A similar investigation into the Kern County Sheriff’s Office ended last month. [The Los Angeles Times]If you missed it, Mr. Becerra was tapped to join the Biden administration to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

	<title>Even for Bargain Hunters, Green Cars Make Sense</title>
	<author>Margaret Renkl</author>
	<body>NASHVILLE — In this family, we are not new-car people. My husband and I buy used vehicles, and we keep them until the cost of patching them up far exceeds their value, a time-honored practice known as driving a car into the ground. We don’t drive a lot, either: My husband works a mile and a half from our house, and I work from a home office. I kept thinking about electric cars anyway.We didn’t actually need a new vehicle when we started shopping. My 2006 minivan was working fine, and my husband’s 2001 minivan was working fine, too. But it was 2019, and our youngest child was a junior in college. We had long since aged out of the minivan cohort.Meanwhile, evidence of the growing climate calamity was becoming clearer and grimmer with every new study — and with every wildfire, every drought, every hurricane — even as the Trump administration kept rolling back environmental protections at a breathtaking rate. I felt a rising desperation to do everything possible to reduce my own carbon footprint, to foster as much biodiversity as I could on my own little half-acre plot of ground.The earth cannot be saved by personal actions alone, but there are many practical ways a person can help the environment anyway: lowering the thermostat, buying organics, eating less meat, skipping the lawn-care chemicals, planting native shrubs and trees, buying carbon offsets, subscribing to a renewable energy program, eliminating single-use plastics and other disposables. All of those changes, and many others, are important because they mean treading a bit more lightly on a suffering earth.But the single greatest change we can make is to change the way we get around. “Transportation is the largest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the United States today, and the bulk of those emissions come from driving in our cities and suburbs,” as Nadja Popovich and Denise Lu noted in a feature for The Times last fall. According to their interactive map, total greenhouse emissions rose 88 percent in Nashville from 1990 to 2017, and that’s not simply because of population growth. Per-person emissions were up 9 percent in the same time frame. Never mind the environment: At this rate, Nashvillians will soon find it difficult to breathe.No doubt we already do. Data collected during the pandemic quarantines last spring suggest that deaths in the United States from illnesses like asthma, lung disease and heart disease dropped by roughly 25 percent because of the improvement in air quality while fewer vehicles were on the roads.Biking and walking are the most ecologically sound ways to get around, of course, and taking public transportation is second best. But if, like my family, you live in a place with a profoundly limited public-transportation system and few pedestrian-friendly streets, driving is a necessary evil. If you have to go somewhere, an electric vehicle is the third-best way to get there.The cost of an electric car can be prohibitive, it’s true, or at least it can appear to be from a glance at the window sticker. But we chose a Nissan Leaf, a vehicle made by our neighbors down in Smyrna, Tenn., and the model we bought qualified for the highest possible federal tax credit. So the actual cost of our car was $7,500 less than the price we paid for it, even if it didn’t seem that way when we signed the papers.Besides the tax credit — which varies from vehicle to vehicle and has already expired on some of the most popular models, including all Teslas — electric cars are less expensive to maintain. A new analysis by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the total cost of ownership is actually lower for many electric vehicles, over the lifetime of the car, than for their combustion engine equivalents. And from an environmental standpoint, there’s no comparison at all, even factoring in the higher emissions involved in producing an electric vehicle’s giant battery.None of these things matter if you can’t afford to buy a car. So many people are struggling to pay for food right now that it feels unseemly to be discussing the economy of electric cars. But if the time is coming when you’ll need to purchase a car anyway, or if you’re the kind of consumer who tends to drive a car into the ground but can afford to rethink that policy, driving an electric vehicle has become a more practical option than you might realize.Even without the tax credit, many upcoming models are projected to cost no more than their carbon-spewing counterparts. The number of purchase options is about to explode, too, so you don’t have to give your money to Elon Musk if you want to drive an electric vehicle.It’s true that it can take some planning to keep the car charged. We don’t have a garage, so we can’t charge our Leaf if it rains, and even with a battery range of more than 200 miles, this car will never be our go-to vehicle for road trips. When public chargers become more plentiful, as they must for electric vehicles to become truly ubiquitous, there will still be the matter of how long they take to charge. The most powerful charger publicly available still needs close to an hour to charge our car’s drained battery, and the most powerful charger on the market isn’t available at the average highway exit.But none of these potential liabilities should be deal breakers. I love our little red Leaf, and I have never had a single moment of buyer’s remorse since we brought it home. It’s quiet, it’s comfortable, and it’s amazingly fun to drive. Like every other vehicle we have owned, we expect to keep it for another 12 or 15 years. All I can hope is that by the time we need to replace it, all our options will be electric. Because if they aren’t, the planet will pay a terrible price.Margaret Renkl is a contributing opinion writer who covers flora, fauna, politics and culture in the American South.

	<title>California recommends pausing a batch of Moderna vaccines after possible ‘severe’ allergic reactions.</title>
	<author>Sarah Mervosh</author>
	<body>The California state epidemiologist has recommended that the state pause the distribution of more than 330,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine after a “higher than usual” number of people showed signs of a possible severe allergic reaction.The recommendation comes at a dire moment in California, which is experiencing one of the most acute outbreaks in the nation. About 40,000 people are testing positive each day — the equivalent of the daily caseload for the entire United States as recently as September — and California’s hospital beds are filling up.The state epidemiologist, Dr. Erica S. Pan, made the recommendation “out of an extreme abundance of caution” after several people who received the vaccine at one community clinic needed medical attention in the span of 24 hours. Each appeared to experience a possible “severe” allergic reaction, and officials recommended not using other vaccines from that batch until an investigation was completed, the health department said in a statement on Sunday.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an example of a severe allergic reaction is if a patient needs to go to a hospital or be treated with epinephrine.The recent reactions were related to a vaccine distribution at Petco Park in San Diego, a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health said. It was not immediately clear how the delay would affect the state’s overall rollout of vaccines, which has been choppy and plagued with confusion.The possible allergic reactions had stemmed from the same batch of Moderna vaccines, which included more than 330,000 doses, among 3.5 million vaccines allocated to the state. California has distributed less than a third of its allocated vaccines, below the national average, with 2.2 percent of the state’s population having received a first dose, according to a New York Times vaccine tracker.Allergic reactions are a rare response to some vaccines. Some estimates suggest that for a similar type of coronavirus vaccine, made by Pfizer-BioNTech, the risk of severe allergic reaction is about 1 in 100,000.</body>

	<title>Rudy Giuliani Sued by Dominion Voting Systems Over False Election Claims</title>
	<author>Nick Corasaniti</author>
	<body>Dominion Voting Systems filed a defamation lawsuit on Monday against Rudolph W. Giuliani, the  lawyer for Donald J. Trump and former mayor of New York City who played a key role in the former president’s monthslong effort to subvert the 2020 election.The 107-page lawsuit, filed in the Federal District Court in Washington, accuses Mr. Giuliani of carrying out “a viral disinformation campaign about Dominion” made up of “demonstrably false” allegations, in part to enrich himself through legal fees and his podcast.The suit seeks damages of more than $1.3 billion and is based on more than 50 statements Mr. Giuliani made at legislative hearings, on Twitter, on his podcast and in the conservative news media, where he spun a fictitious narrative of a plot by one of the biggest voting machine manufacturers in the country to flip votes to President Biden.Mr. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers and confidants, has faced continuing fallout for his highly visible efforts to reverse the election outcome. This month, the chairman of the New York State Senate’s judiciary committee formally requested that the state court system strip Mr. Giuliani of his law license.In a statement released by text message late Monday morning, Mr. Giuliani said that the lawsuit amounted to intimidation and that he was contemplating a countersuit. “Dominion’s defamation lawsuit for $1.3B will allow me to investigate their history, finances, and practices fully and completely,” Mr. Giuliani said. “The amount being asked for is, quite obviously, intended to frighten people of faint heart. It is another act of intimidation by the hate-filled left-wing to wipe out and censor the exercise of free speech, as well as the ability of lawyers to defend their clients vigorously. As such, we will investigate a countersuit against them for violating these Constitutional rights.”On his radio show on Monday afternoon, Mr. Giuliani seemed to welcome a trial. “We’ll have a nice fight, a real fight, and by fight, I don’t mean, don’t mean any words of violence,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I fight in the courtroom, you know? That’s what I always mean when I talk about fight. We fight in the courtroom. We fight in the debate hall. I got a pretty good record in court. And I’m a damn good investigator.”Taken together with a lawsuit the company filed this month against Sidney Powell, another lawyer who was allied with Mr. Trump, the suit represents a point-by-point rebuke of one of the more outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding last year’s election. The president’s allies had contended that the voting machine company — which was also used in states during Mr. Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, has been tested by government agencies, and was used in states Mr. Trump carried in 2020 — was somehow involved in a rigged election, partly as a result of ties to a long-deceased Venezuelan dictator. “Dominion was not founded in Venezuela to fix elections for Hugo Chávez,” the suit says. “It was founded in 2002 in John Poulos’s basement in Toronto to help blind people vote on paper ballots.” The suit later adds that the headquarters for the company’s United States subsidiary is in Denver.Laying out a timeline of Mr. Giuliani’s comments about Dominion on Twitter, his podcast and Fox News, the company notes that Mr. Giuliani avoided mentioning Dominion in court, where he could have faced legal ramifications for falsehoods. “Notably, not a single one of the three complaints signed and filed by Giuliani and other attorneys for the Trump Campaign in the Pennsylvania action contained any allegations about Dominion,” the lawsuit says.The lawsuit also links Mr. Giuliani’s false statements about Dominion to the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, noting that he mentioned the company in his speech at a rally for Mr. Trump before the attack, as well as numerous times on social media as the Capitol was breached.“Having been deceived by Giuliani and his allies into thinking that they were not criminals — but patriots ‘Defend[ing] the Republic’ from Dominion and its co-conspirators — they then bragged about their involvement in the crime on social media,” the suit states.Thomas A. Clare, a lawyer representing Dominion, said that the riot had not factored into the decision to sue Mr. Giuliani, but that it did show just how seriously Mr. Trump’s followers had taken the falsehoods told about the election.“From a defamation law perspective, it just demonstrates the depth to which these statements sink in to people,” Mr. Clare said in an interview. “That people don’t just read them and tune them out. It goes to the core of their belief system, which puts them in a position to take action in the real world.”John Poulos, the chief executive officer of Dominion, said that his company had taken legal action against Mr. Giuliani both to correct the record about Dominion and restore trust in American electoral systems. “Not only have these lies damaged the good name of my company,” Mr. Poulos said of Mr. Giuliani’s false claims, “but they also undermined trust in American democratic institutions, drowning out the remarkable work of elections officials and workers, who ensured a transparent and secure election. The thousands of hand recounts and audits that proved machines counted accurately continue to be overshadowed by disinformation.”Dominion is a major manufacturer of voting machine equipment in the United States, second only to Election Systems &amp; Software. Different models of Dominion machines were used in more than two dozen states — red, blue and battleground — during the 2020 election.The company had previously warned Mr. Giuliani, sending a letter in late December that told him to preserve all records of his claims and stop making false statements, and warned that legal action was imminent. But Mr. Giuliani continued with his false claims of fraud, even arguing on Twitter days after receiving the letter that “phony Dominion voting machines” needed to be investigated.Numerous inquiries. Since former President Donald Trump left office, there have been many investigations and inquiries into his businesses and personal affairs. Here’s a list of those ongoing:Investigation into criminal fraud. The Manhattan district attorney’s office and the New York attorney general’s office have been investigating whether Mr. Trump or his family business, the Trump Organization, intentionally submitted false property values to potential lenders. In February, two Manhattan prosecutors resigned, clouding the future of the district attorney’s case.Investigation into tax evasion. As part of their investigation, in July 2021, the Manhattan district attorney’s office charged the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its chief financial officer, with orchestrating a 15-year scheme to evade taxes. In February, lawyers for both parties asked a judge to dismiss the charges.Investigation into election interference. The Atlanta district attorney is conducting a criminal investigation of election interference in Georgia by Mr. Trump and his allies.Investigation into the Trump National Golf Club. Prosecutors in the district attorney’s office in Westchester County, N.Y., appear to be focused at least in part on whether the Trump Organization misled local officials about the property’s value to reduce its taxes.Civil investigation into Trump Organization. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, is seeking to question Mr. Trump under oath in a civil fraud investigation of his business practices.As recently as last week, Mr. Giuliani was on his New York City-based radio show saying that “so long as you have Dominion, there is clear and present danger” that election results could be rigged. He added that he had “boxes of evidence to support his claims.”Dominion has indicated that it plans to file more lawsuits. The suit against Mr. Giuliani says he acted with other prominent conservatives and news networks, including Mike Lindell, Lou Dobbs, Fox News, Fox Business, Newsmax and One America News Network.Mr. Clare, Dominion’s lawyer, left open the possibility of litigation against Mr. Trump.“We’re not ruling anybody out,” he said. “Obviously, this lawsuit against the president’s lawyer moves one step closer to the former president and understanding what his role was and wasn’t.”The threats from Dominion have prompted some conciliatory responses from conservative news outlets hoping to avoid a legal battle. This month, the American Thinker, a conservative website, posted an apologetic note saying that its reports about Dominion “are completely false and have no basis in fact” and that “it was wrong for us to publish these false statements.”Mr. Giuliani was one of the main public faces of the effort to reverse the election results, with Mr. Trump rarely appearing in public and preferring to send out broadsides on Twitter against the democratic process.Dominion argues that Mr. Giuliani profited significantly from his false claims, noting that he “reportedly demanded $20,000 per day” for his legal services to Mr. Trump and “cashed in by hosting a podcast where he exploited election falsehoods to market gold coins, supplements, cigars and protection from ‘cyberthieves.’”The lawsuit notes just how quickly and widely the lies and false narratives had spread leading up to the riot at the Capitol. “Over a three-hour period on December 21, 2020, the terms ‘dominion’ and ‘fraud’ were tweeted out together by more than 2,200 users with over 8.75 million total followers,” the suit says.The reach of the disinformation about the company brought countless threats of violence against employees, the suit claims. One employee received text messages stating: “We are already watching you. Come clean and you will live.” A voice mail message to customer support said, “We’re bringing back the firing squad.”Because of these threats, Dominion has spent $565,000 on personal security, according to the lawsuit. The company claimed to have incurred $1.17 million in total expenses relating to the disinformation campaign after the election.“Giuliani’s statements,” the suit states, “were calculated to — and did in fact — provoke outrage and cause Dominion enormous harm.”Alan Feuer and Azi Paybarah contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Biden plans to roll out dozens of executive orders in his first 10 days as president.</title>
	<author>Peter Baker</author>
	<body>President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to start his administration with dozens of executive directives on top of expansive legislative proposals in a 10-day blitz meant to signal a turning point for a nation reeling from disease, economic turmoil, racial strife and now the aftermath of the assault on the Capitol.Mr. Biden’s team has developed a raft of decrees that he can issue on his own authority after the inauguration on Wednesday to begin reversing some of President Trump’s most hotly disputed policies. Advisers hope the flurry of action, without waiting for Congress, will establish a sense of momentum for the new president even as the Senate puts his predecessor on trial.On his first day in office alone, Mr. Biden intends a flurry of executive orders that will be partly substantive and partly symbolic. They include rescinding the travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries; rejoining the Paris climate change accord; extending pandemic-related limits on evictions and student loan payments; issuing a mask mandate for federal property and interstate travel; and ordering agencies to figure out how to reunite children separated from their families after crossing the border, according to a memo circulated on Saturday by Ron Klain, his incoming White House chief of staff, and obtained by The New York Times.The blueprint of executive action comes after Mr. Biden announced that he will push Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion package of economic stimulus and pandemic relief, signaling a willingness to be aggressive on policy issues and confronting Republicans from the start to take their lead from him.He also plans to send sweeping immigration legislation on his first day in office, providing a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people living in the country illegally. Along with his promise to vaccinate 100 million Americans for the coronavirus in his first 100 days, it is an expansive set of priorities for a new president that could be a defining test of his deal-making abilities and command of the federal government.</body>

	<title>When the Removal of 2 N.F.L. Stars From Playoff Games Is Progress</title>
	<author>Ken Belson</author>
	<body>In a season dominated by the N.F.L.’s efforts to play a full schedule during a pandemic, many other health issues have been overshadowed, particularly concussions, an issue that has dogged the league in years past.The topic returned to the forefront over the weekend when two of the league’s best players — the winners of the last two Most Valuable Player Awards, no less — were knocked out of their divisional round playoff games with symptoms consistent with concussions. The N.F.L. received kudos for following its own player safety rules, which were developed after years of criticism that not enough was being done to prevent head hits.Yet as is so often the case, hits to the head that were not penalized garnered just as much as attention. They suggest the league is far from eliminating the helmet-to-helmet hits that have led to so many head injuries.Most spectators, though, are more likely to remember the instances when star players leave games and don’t return, mostly because of their impact on the team’s chances of winning and because they are the reason fans watch the games in the first place.The first star player knocked out of a game came on Saturday in Buffalo when Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson slammed his head on the turf after he was thrown to the ground by two Bills defenders. Jackson grabbed his helmet and lay on his back as trainers rushed out to examine him. He was taken to the locker room for examination and did not return.On Sunday, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had his neck twisted by a Cleveland Browns defender as he was dragged to the ground. Mahomes wobbled as he stood up, and two teammates had to hold him upright until trainers could walk him off the field. Mahomes, too, was taken to the locker room and ruled out of the game. The Chiefs confirmed on Monday that Mahomes was in the concussion protocol, but did not confirm he actually had a concussion.While fans of the Ravens and the Chiefs would vigorously disagree, others — especially the critics of the league who have long accused it of turning a blind eye to head injuries — might consider the removal of Jackson and Mahomes welcome sights.“The handling of Lamar Jackson’s and Patrick Mahomes’s concussions shows progress,” Chris Nowinski, chief executive of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, wrote on Twitter. “15 years ago: They may not miss a play. 10 years ago: Smelling salts on the bench &amp; return. 5 years ago: 4th quarter comeback. Today: 2 top QB’s treated responsibly.”Indeed, the N.F.L. has focused more on head hits in recent years. The league has strengthened rules against hitting quarterbacks and players who lower their helmets to initiate contact. There were 125 roughing-the-passer penalties called this season, a 40 percent jump compared to 2016, according to the N.F.L. Penalties website, which tracks infractions. This season, there were 37 fouls called for illegal use of the helmet, one more than in 2019, the N.F.L. said.There were 224 reported concussions last season, a decline of 4.7 percent compared to 2018. The league has not yet reported complete concussion figures for this season, but they are likely to decline again because there were no preseason games and many teams canceled some practices to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus.Many concussions, though, go unreported, either because doctors and neurologists at the game failed to spot them or because the players masked their symptoms.Then there are the cases in which players smack helmets, no penalty flag is thrown, and no doctors intervene. That’s what happened late in the first half of the Chiefs-Browns matchup. Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield threw a long pass to receiver Rashard Higgins, who ran a few strides and dived for the pylon on the goal line. Just as his outstretched arms and the ball were about to reach the goal line, Chiefs safety Daniel Sorenson launched himself at Higgins.Replays showed Sorenson lowered his helmet and crashed it into Higgins’s head. Higgins fumbled the ball out of bounds in the end zone, a touchback, ending the Browns’ chance for a touchdown and giving possession to the Chiefs at their 20-yard line.Sorenson was not penalized for leading with his helmet, and the Browns were unable to challenge the play because helmet-to-helmet hits are not reviewable. But the noncall, and others like it, did not escape notice by football insiders.“The number of ‘player safety’ penalties not being called by @NFL officials this entire weekend is concerning &amp; unsettling,” Scott Pioli, a former director of player personnel for the New England Patriots and an analyst for CBS and NFL Network, wrote on Twitter. “A LOT of leading with head penalties not being called on defenders AND ballcarriers all weekend. Why have we abandoned the rules for the playoffs?”With the Chiefs advancing to the A.F.C. championship game, Mahomes’s recovery will remain a topic of interest. After Sunday’s game, Coach Andy Reid said his quarterback “got hit in the back of the head and kinda knocked the wind out of him and everything else with it.” But he added that Mahomes was “doing great” and passed some tests, without specifying what they were.According to N.F.L. guidelines, Mahomes must rest until his symptoms are gone and his performance on neurological exams is normal. He can then gradually increase the amount of exercise and stretching. Assuming he has no setbacks, Mahomes can then resume some activities, including strength training. That would lead to noncontact football activities like throwing and running. If all those hurdles are passed, he could be cleared by an independent neurologist to participate in the next practice or game.Players, though, can pass these tests and not report lingering symptoms, like memory loss or headaches. “It’s tough as a player to know what to report,” Nowinski said.In the past five seasons, the median number of days it took a quarterback to return from a concussion was seven. With that in mind, Mahomes could be back on the field when the Chiefs play the Bills on Sunday.</body>

	<title>He Climbed 800 Feet in a Wheelchair. Hong Kong Watched in Awe.</title>
	<author>Tiffany May</author>
	<body>HONG KONG — Racked by cold and dizzy with vertigo, Lai Chi-wai struck his helmet again and again to stay alert.On he went, pull after hand-searing pull, as he tried to scale a Hong Kong skyscraper by rope while seated in his wheelchair.At 800 feet, though, the gusts grew stronger, relentless. The wheelchair began to spin. Mr. Lai, a former champion rock climber who had never been afraid of heights, began to fear for his life.After swinging in the wind for nearly an hour, he called off the climb, just short of his goal. He was overwhelmed with disappointment. But in the process, he had inspired a city wearied by political turmoil and an unrelenting pandemic, and raised more than $700,000 for charity.During an interview on Monday, Mr. Lai, 38, watched workers remove the ropes and anchors he had used for his climb along the glass facade of the 1,050-foot Nina Tower — a building as tall as the Eiffel Tower — two days before.“Looking up, I can see the adverse conditions I faced, and feel the fear and helplessness as I was suspended midair,” he said. “I also saw how close I was to reaching my goal.”Mr. Lai said he had exceeded his own expectations of his strength, resilience and decision making during his 10-hour ascent. Still, he said, “I didn’t expect that I would be unable to finish, when there was still some strength left in my body. I have no excuses to give as an athlete.”Mr. Lai is a four-time winner of the Asian Rock Climbing Championship and once ranked eighth in the world in the sport. He became paralyzed from the waist down after a car accident nine years ago.Determined to keep climbing, he ascended Lion Rock, a steep mountain ridge that represents Hong Kong’s spirit of resilience amid adversity, in his wheelchair in 2016.A skyscraper became his next target. He sought, as he put it, to “express the Lion Rock spirit in an urban jungle,” by “climbing up continuously.”He began his ascent Saturday morning under blue skies and gentle breezes. But by midafternoon, strong winds were tangling the ropes he used to climb. His wheelchair rocked to and fro, sometimes threatening to ram into the building.He climbed another two dozen stories as the gusts continued to blast in bursts of five to 10 minutes, pausing to untangle the ropes.At 800 feet, as the wind whipped him relentlessly, his arms cramped and his bandaged fingers smarted from blisters. He also felt his body temperature drop. A team of supporters and rescuers sent him messages on his walkie-talkie asking whether he wanted to stop.Days after he called time on the effort, he said, scenes of the climb still filled his head, keeping him awake at night. Back at the skyscraper on Monday, his fingers were raw, so he used only the tip of his thumb to spin the tires of his wheelchair.As of Monday, his efforts have helped raise $735,000 to fund research on a robotic exoskeleton for patients with spinal cord injuries.Well-wishers showered him with praise online. But what many saw as an unimaginable feat of endurance still carried, for him, the sting of an unfulfilled dream.“I can only accept this version of events,” he said. “But as an athlete, I don’t know if this is the best ending. I don’t have closure yet. I’m still looking for answers.”</body>

	<title>An Organ Recital, With a Coronavirus Shot</title>
	<author>Alex Marshall</author>
	<body>SALISBURY, England — On a recent Saturday afternoon, Margaret Drabble, 83, sat beneath the soaring arches of Salisbury Cathedral, swinging her legs back and forth under her chair like a schoolgirl.Minutes earlier, in a booth near the cathedral’s entrance, she had received her first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the coronavirus. But that wasn’t why she was looking so happy, she said. Instead, it was from the elaborate organ music gently reverberating in the cathedral’s interior.“Oh, I just love the organ,” said Drabble, a former schoolteacher. “It’s so beautiful, it almost makes me cry every time I hear it.”“I’ve always wanted to play it,” she said, wistfully. Then, she looked toward the organ’s 4,000 pipes at the front of the cathedral and sat up straight to listen. She had been told to stay put for 15 minutes, to make sure she did not develop an allergic reaction.Britain is in the middle of a mass vaccination drive, racing to outrun the spread of the virus as a new variant discovered in the country surges. So far, some 6.3 million people have received a first dose, just under 10 percent of the population.England’s National Health Service has signed contracts with dozens of large venues that will operate as vaccination centers. On Monday, it announced 33 new locations, including a soccer stadium in Oxford, several sports centers and a concert arena.Patients have been getting the vaccine at Salisbury Cathedral since Jan. 16, and it hosts the inoculation sessions twice a week for around 1,200 people a day. Sessions last about 12 hours, and, for most of that time, David Halls and John Challenger, the cathedral’s organists, provide a musical backing, ranging from well-known hymns to fairground tunes and euphoric classical works.That makes the cathedral one of the few places in the country one can hear live music right now. With much of Britain under lockdown restrictions for the third time, theaters, museums and concert halls have been forced to shut. But in recent weeks, the British government’s race to vaccinate its population has provided some cultural venues with a surprising lease on life.Some — like the Thackray Museum of Medicine in Leeds, in northern England, and the Hertford Theater, just north of London — have become vaccination centers, taking advantage of their large, well ventilated spaces and experience with managing crowds. Visitors now line up to receive shots, instead of to look at display cases or sing along to musicals.At least one well-known London attraction, the Science Museum, is being considered, according to local officials, and even circus operators have offered their big tops.Salisbury Cathedral is, of course, more of a religious venue than a cultural one. But beyond the organ accompaniment, anyone inoculated in the 13th-century Gothic building in southwestern England can also marvel at its architecture and contemplate several artworks throughout its grounds, including a huge reclining figure by the sculptor Henry Moore and a tapestry by the contemporary British artist Grayson Perry.On Saturday, few visitors were looking at those, but several were listening attentively to the music.“I live locally, and we’ve all been saying, ‘Have you been to the organ recital yet?’” said Pam Scoop, 86. “We don’t say, ‘Have you been for a jab?’” she added, using a British term for a shot. She then closed her eyes to listen to Halls play the uplifting Bach chorale “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring.”Nicholas Papadopulos, the cathedral’s dean, said he had offered the building as a vaccine hub as soon as he heard that a successful shot had been developed. “Our thought was a lot of elderly, vulnerable people who hadn’t been out of their homes very much in the last year, if at all, would be coming,” he said, adding that the team wanted to “create an environment that is welcoming and reassuring and soothing.”“The obvious solution was to make music,” he said.David Halls, the cathedral’s music director, said he had started by playing famous classical pieces from the likes of Bach, Mozart and Handel. He said he then decided to branch out, playing show tunes like “Old Man River” and English music-hall hits like “I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside,” hoping they would stir happy memories among older listeners.“The phrase ‘smooth classics’ was what came to mind,” Halls said. “We didn’t want anything too spiky or unpleasant or anything too fast.”John Challenger, the cathedral’s assistant music director, said that some local residents had started emailing requests. Someone had suggested a work by the Australian organist and composer George Thalben-Ball, he said; on Saturday, someone else emailed to ask for a piece by Olivier Messiaen, including the time they would like the work played.“It’s weird what people want, isn’t it?” Challenger said.Dan Henderson, one of the doctors overseeing the center, said the cathedral was a perfect space for vaccinations, as its large, drafty space lowers the risk of catching the virus. The music was a bonus, he added, but it did have a medical benefit because it lowered people’s anxiety. “It’s changing this from a medical intervention to an event,” he said, “and that really makes patients at ease.”There was only one, occasional, downside, he added. “We’ve had patients sit in the observation area for half-an-hour listening to the music, when they’re only meant to be there for 15 minutes. So sometimes it is actually impeding the flow of patients,” Henderson said. “But I think that’s quite a lovely problem to have.”Many visitors on that recent Saturday seemed to have that urge to stick around and enjoy the music. Sue Phillips, 77, was sitting in the waiting area with her husband, William, after getting a shot. The organists were taking a break, and she seemed disappointed by the silence.“It’d be lovely if the organ were playing,” Phillips said. “All these old people, including us, have had a year deprived of culture, music and beauty, then we get a chance to get our jab to organ music.”But shortly after, the organ surged into life and the familiar notes of Hubert Parry’s “Jerusalem,” a patriotic English hymn, filled the space.Phillips’s eyes brightened above her mask. “Oh, wonderful!” she said. “This is magical.”Looking at her husband, she said: “I think we’ll stay for another 10 minutes.”</body>

	<title>When Theatermakers Long for the Stage, Playfully</title>
	<author>Laura Collins-Hughes</author>
	<body>“These films were made by theater people.”It’s just one line of text on the Exponential Festival website, explaining the provenance of a pair of video shorts in the lineup: zestfully odd and playful mash-ups of the first piece in Samuel Beckett’s doom-laden prose collection “Texts for Nothing,” from a company called Accent Wall Productions.Yet that simple declarative statement gets to the crux of the matter, which is that the experimental artists behind “The Puzzlers” and “The Puzzlers 2: Black Box” — notably including Jess Barbagallo and Emily Davis — know who they are, which shut-down art form they miss with a piercing longing and which different kind of work they’re making in the meantime.And they’re channeling into it a heightened, deadpan loopiness that elicits belly laughs.These two are the best of the handful of shows I watched at this year’s free, online festival.In “The Puzzlers,” an actor named Jay (Barbagallo, who shares the writing credit for both scripts with Beckett) is at home in Brooklyn with his acting coach (Lucy Kaminsky) and his dog (Bluet), struggling to memorize a section of “Texts for Nothing.” His grown daughter (Davis) interrupts, scandalized that he spent $7.49 on a little tub of almond pesto.“I’m an artist. I’m not a professional grocery shopper,” Jay says, attacked. “I’m just a guy, trying to learn a monologue, because it’s been a really long time since he applied himself to anything.”However unobtrusively, this is clearly a pandemic piece. On the festival website, Accent Wall Productions describes itself as “a survival-based art collective formed between four friends and a dog in March 2020.” The fourth human member of the group, André Callot, is credited as the editor of “The Puzzlers 2,” in which he also delivers a wonderfully atmospheric voice-over monologue. (“How long have I been here, what a question, I’ve often wondered.” And so on.)The second short is at least as friendly as the first but far more aching. Told in flashback, it achieves something I had not seen in all the deluge of video that has come in these past 10 months. Largely through black-and-white rehearsal stills of Barbagallo, Davis and Kaminsky, shot at The Brick in Brooklyn, it captures what theater feels like — the everyday incantation of it, and how unreachably far away that seems now.These two “Puzzlers” pieces are the start of a projected series that will adapt all of “Texts for Nothing.” Yes, please. We need some more.Elsewhere at the festival, the Fringe and Fur show “Madge Love” is billed as “an interactive theater-film hybrid.”The thing about theater, though, is that once you take away the live acting and live audience, shoot the performance on video with tight frames and fast intercuts, then layer in voice-overs and a score, what you have is a film, not a hybrid.Written and directed by Genee Coreno, with cinematography, animation and video editing by Dena Kopolovich, “Madge Love” is the story of Sissy (Arden Winant) and Madge (Lilja Owsley), teenagers with the kind of romantic streak that makes them love speaking bad French together.They also have a fondness for the very creepy Catherine Deneuve movie “Belle de Jour.” Their moody passion for each other is all mixed up in what they’ve already learned about the connection between sex, violence and female suffering at the hands of men.This is a good-looking production, beautifully lit by Marika Kent. The low-fi set (by Kent and Emily Greco) is the production’s most obvious remnant of theater: a metal truss standing in for a tree, a rippling blue tarp for water. We see painted cinder block walls, and the actors’ body mics. (The sound design and composition are by Coco Walsh.)One disappointment: The interactivity turns out to be minimal.“Animal Empire,” a digital mini-musical written, directed and produced by Yeujia Low, gestures not at all toward the stage. The story of an uprising against humans fomented by creatures of the farm and forest, it’s both strident and twee, and it makes the tactical error of opening on an off-putting note, with a character (represented, like most of the others, by an emoji head) doing bad vocal exercises.It does, however, have very amusing singing cameos by a snail (Low) and a sloth (Jason Pu), who can be counted on to be late for everything. There is also a winningly intimidating boar (Patrick Sweeney).A look at the script suggests that this version of “Animal Empire” is one draft of a more ambitious work in progress. For now, the best part is the rebellion itself, vividly animated like a music video, with animals fighting back everywhere.It’s a little weird right now to delight at insurrection, but this one involves fish and geese and deer. And, hey, they are unarmed.The Puzzlers + The Puzzlers 2: Black BoxStreaming at theexponentialfestival.org/thepuzzlersreturntentatively.Madge LoveStreaming at video.eko.com/v/Ap6aRL.Animal EmpireThrough Feb. 28; theexponentialfestival.org/animalempire.</body>

	<title>The World’s Rarest Turtle Has a Shot at Escaping Extinction</title>
	<author>Rachel Nuwer</author>
	<body>In 2019, the world’s rarest turtle suffered a staggering loss. The last known female of the species, Swinhoe’s softshell turtle, died after an artificial insemination procedure at the Chinese zoo where she and her mate lived. This left the confirmed tally for the species at just two individuals: the male in China, plus one individual of unknown sex in a lake in Vietnam.There may still be hope for the species. Conservationists and veterinarians recently announced that the Vietnamese turtle is a female. At the same time, exhaustive hunts for other surviving Swinhoe’s softshell turtles in Vietnam have verified at least two other promising leads.“This is very big news in Vietnam,” said Hoang Bich Thuy, the country director for the Wildlife Conservation Society. “Even people who don’t work in conservation, my friends and family, saw it on national TV and were like, ‘Oh! There’s new hope!’”Swinhoe’s softshell turtles, which can weigh more than 370 pounds, be more than 6-feet long and live for over 100 years, hold a special cultural significance in Vietnam, where they are known as Hoan Kiem — “returned sword” — turtles. In the 15th century, a well-known folk tale goes, Vietnam’s king, Le Loi, used a magical sword to defeat the Ming dynasty army. When the battle was over, the king gave the sword to a turtle god in Hoan Kiem lake in central Hanoi.In recent decades as Vietnam urbanized, one Hoan Kiem turtle continued to live in the lake, despite high levels of pollution. But in 2016, this last individual — a revered male known as Great-Grandfather Turtle — died, likely of natural causes.The sacred status of the Swinhoe’s softshell turtles living in Hoan Kiem lake did not extend to members of the same species living elsewhere in Vietnam, however. The species was heavily hunted for food and hammered by habitat destruction.In 2003, Tim McCormack, director of the Asian Turtle Program, began surveying rivers where the species historically lived. He turned up a few shells in peoples’ homes, and most fishermen told him that the once-bountiful animal had disappeared. Searches in China, where the species is commonly known as the Yangtze giant softshell turtle, were also discouraging.Mr. McCormack and his colleagues finally caught a break in 2007 when a team member managed to get a photo of a Swinhoe’s softshell turtle discovered in Dong Mo lake, in an area west of Hanoi. They hired fishermen to keep an eye on the turtle and continued work on habitat improvement, community awareness and further surveys to find additional Swinhoe’s softshell turtles. In 2014, they used genetic tools to confirm the turtle was a member of the species.Five years after the discovery, the surveys delivered reports of another turtle in Xuan Khanh lake, just north of Dong Mo lake. In 2017, scientists from Washington State University used eDNA — a method that looks for a target species’ genetic material in environmental samples — to establish that the Xuan Khanh animal is most likely a Swinhoe’s softshell turtle.In receiving this news of a probable second animal in Vietnam, “it’s hard to describe my overwhelmed feelings,” said Nguyen Tai Thang, project manager for the Swinhoe’s softshell turtle at the Asian Turtle Program. “It was like going on an endless expedition, and at some point, you wonder whether you are on the right track, and then you finally see a sign showing that just ahead, you’ll soon reach your destination.”There have also been sightings of another giant turtle that lives in the same lake as the female Swinhoe’s softshell turtle. There have been no signs of reproduction, however, which could mean that the other turtle is also a female. On the other hand, it could also be that the animal is an exotic species that found its way into the lake.Although the identities of the Xuan Khanh and the second Dong Mo turtles need to be confirmed, the hope of a second or even third Swinhoe’s softshell turtle is driving political and scientific interest. In 2019, the Vietnamese government released a turtle conservation action plan, developed with the Asian Turtle Program. Authorities in Hanoi announced an additional plan to protect members of the species found anywhere within the city’s jurisdiction — not just in Hoan Kiem lake.“The confirmation of the female Hoan Kiem turtle brought us a new hope to restore the population of this most precious and endangered turtle species,” said Nguyen Huy Dang, deputy director of Hanoi’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.Last October, government officials, conservationists and fishermen trapped the Swinhoe’s softshell turtle that was first discovered in 2007 and used ultrasound to verify that she is a female. The next step, Mr. McCormack said, is to capture the other two individuals to identify them and determine their sex. This will likely happen in the spring, when water levels are lower and the reptiles become more active. If they find a male, the plan is to unite him with the female, likely in a semi-wild enclosure on Dong Mo lake.Discussions are also underway about mating the Vietnamese female with the Chinese male, said Gerald Kuchling, a project leader for the Turtle Survival Alliance who helped with efforts to breed the species in China. Scientists previously learned that the Chinese male’s penis is heavily damaged, however, preventing him from being able to successfully deliver semen into a female. This means there is little point in bringing the two animals together — something that would be challenging, anyway, for political reasons, according to Dr. Kuchling. Instead, he said, semen could be collected from the male in China and transported to Vietnam for artificial insemination.“Even if a male becomes available in Vietnam, involving the Chinese male through an artificial approach will still be significant to broaden the gene pool for the long term genetic health and survival of the species,” Dr. Kuchling said. “If no other male can be found, however, this approach will be the last chance, and imperative.”From their surveys across northern Vietnam, Mr. McCormack, Mr. Nguyen and their colleagues have identified a handful of additional places that they believe other Swinhoe’s softshell turtles could still be living. “I was born in a small village next to the Red River where there used to be many individuals of this species,” Mr. Nguyen said. “My friends and I used to gather at the village temple to hear stories related to the species, told to us by elders.”Finding more animals in the wild will ensure not only conservation of the species, he said, but that “the legend lives on.”</body>

	<title>The House is poised to transmit its article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate.</title>
	<author>Catie Edmondson</author>
	<body>The House is poised to deliver to the Senate on Monday its article of impeachment charging former President Donald J. Trump with “incitement of insurrection,” formally advancing the process even as the trial itself has been delayed.At 7 p.m., the House impeachment managers will march the charge across the Capitol. That is the official, if ceremonial, start of the Senate trial process, during which the managers are expected to make their case that Mr. Trump should be held accountable for his role in inciting the deadly assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6. Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and the lead impeachment manager, will read the article on the Senate floor.Senate leaders last week struck a deal to pause the trial until the week of Feb. 8 to give the prosecution and the defense time to draft and exchange legal briefs, a timetable that also allows President Biden time to install members of his cabinet. Senators will be sworn in as jurors on Tuesday.“During that period, the Senate will continue to do other business for the American people, such as cabinet nominations and the Covid relief bill, which would provide relief for millions of Americans who are suffering during this pandemic,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader.The looming trial has already sent lawmakers burrowing into dueling positions, deepening the schisms in an already divided Senate. As some Republicans in the chamber, including Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, have grown increasingly worried that failing to distance themselves from Mr. Trump could damage the party for years to come, others have made clear that they oppose even the idea of a trial and will try to dismiss the charge before it begins.In a Monmouth University poll released on Monday, 52 percent of Americans said they wanted the Senate to convict Mr. Trump, compared with 44 percent who did not. But the poll found overwhelming opposition among Republicans, with only 11 percent saying they wanted him to be convicted and 85 percent opposing it.Impeachment managers have signaled that they intend to present a straightforward case focused on the storming of the Capitol, which played out in public view and left many of the senators who will serve as jurors in the trial cowering for safety. Representative Madeleine Dean, Democrat of Pennsylvania and one of the impeachment managers, said on Sunday that she expected the trial to “go faster” than Mr. Trump’s first impeachment trial in 2020, which lasted 21 days.“Some people would like us to turn the page: ‘Oh, let’s move on,’” Ms. Dean said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We must remember, I believe, that this impeachment trial, I hope conviction, ultimate disqualification, are the very first powerful steps toward unity.”</body>

	<title>Supreme Court Won’t Hear Appeal from Sheldon Silver, Former N.Y. Lawmaker</title>
	<author>Adam Liptak</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday let stand the conviction of Sheldon Silver, the once-powerful State Assembly speaker in New York who went to prison last summer on federal corruption charges.As is the court’s custom, its brief order gave no reasons for turning down the case. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, saying the court should have heard the case to clarify its rulings on bribery and extortion.The court has in recent years been skeptical of broad interpretations of public corruption laws, saying they are not all-purpose devices to ensure good government.Mr. Silver’s lawyers told the justices that prosecutors had overreached in his case by securing his conviction of accepting bribes in a real estate scheme without proving that those who made the payments had intended to influence particular official actions.The federal appeals court in New York, in affirming Mr. Silver’s conviction for his role in the scheme, said it was enough that he understood that he would take official actions in exchange for the payments.Mr. Silver, a Democrat, was convicted in 2015 of accepting nearly $4 million in illicit payments and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. But that conviction was overturned on appeal following a 2016 United States Supreme Court decision that unanimously overturned the broadly similar conviction of Bob McDonnell, a former Republican governor of Virginia.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the court in the McDonnell case, said that only formal and concrete government actions may be the subject of prosecutions under federal public-corruption laws.Mr. Silver was retried and convicted in 2018. According to prosecutors, Mr. Silver had arranged for real estate developers to hire the law firm Goldberg &amp; Iryami, which sent Mr. Silver a portion of its fees. Mr. Silver then supported legislation that benefited the developers.Judge Richard C. Wesley, writing for the Second Circuit panel, said there was ample evidence that Mr. Silver understood that the payments in the real estate scheme were made in return for commitments to take official actions. But there was no requirement, Judge Wesley wrote, of a “meeting of the minds” between those making and receiving the payments about what those actions should be.In urging the Supreme Court to hear Mr. Silver’s case, his lawyers said that legal standard gave prosecutors too much power.“The Second Circuit approved jury instructions that allowed a state official to be convicted of federal bribery on a jury’s after-the-fact finding that the official had an unexpressed, unilateral understanding (or misunderstanding) that he was being bribed,” the lawyers wrote in their petition seeking Supreme Court review. The ruling, they wrote, “places every official at the mercy of federal prosecutors, dismantling this court’s work at reining in federal prosecutors.”The brief cited the McDonnell case, in which Mr. McDonnell had been accused of accepting luxury products, loans and vacations from a business executive in return for arranging meetings and urging underlings to consider the executive’s requests.It also cited last year’s ruling in the “Bridgegate” case, in which the court unanimously overturned the convictions of two defendants in a case from New Jersey. The defendants, former associates of Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey at the time, were accused of taking part in a 2013 scheme meant to punish one of the governor’s political opponents that ended up creating four days of enormous traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge.That was an abuse of power, the Supreme Court ruled, but not a federal crime.Prosecutors in Mr. Silver’s case responded that earlier Supreme Court decisions “confirm that the government must prove that the public official understood that he was accepting the bribe in return for an official act” but do not require proof “that the bribe giver reached an agreement with the official or shared the official’s corrupt purpose.”Mr. Silver, 76, served as speaker for more than two decades and played a leading role in almost every major aspect of state politics. In the final days of his administration, President Donald J. Trump considered granting clemency to Mr. Silver, who was sentenced to a 78-month prison term, but decided not to after criticism from Republicans in New York.</body>

	<title>The Unrelenting Spread of the Virus in Dozens of ZIP Codes</title>

Bensonhurst and Brighton Beach in Brooklyn. South Ozone Park and Flushing in Queens. Hunts Point in the Bronx. South Beach and the surrounding neighborhoods on Staten Island. And Washington Heights in Manhattan.Despite a scramble to vaccinate people as quickly as possible, the seven-day average rate of positive test results across more than 50 ZIP codes in these and other New York City neighborhoods remains over 10 percent, according to the most recently available city data.[Health experts are wondering if officials will mull new steps and restrictions.]The rates underscore the need for people to adhere to public health guidelines, experts and officials say.Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday that the seven-day average positive test rate citywide was 8.82 percent, with more than 4,500 new cases and 273 new hospitalizations.Officials note that the high rates are occurring despite an indoor dining ban, low transmission in schools and many companies still sticking to remote work.“The reality is that personal behavior is what matters now,” Gareth Rhodes, an adviser to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said.If people are not careful, epidemiologists said, a mutation of the virus — such as the more contagious variant from Britain — will have the opportunity to take hold, threatening the effectiveness of vaccination efforts.The limited supply of doses has slowed the vaccination effort, with Mr. Cuomo projecting last week that the state could temporarily run out. But on Sunday, officials said they had received a new batch of the two-dose vaccine and sent 250,400 first doses and 428,100 second doses around the state.Nearly 1.3 million doses have been administered statewide, the vast majority being the first dose of a two-dose vaccine.Mr. Cuomo has said that at the current pace, it would be many months before even those people currently eligible for inoculation get both their doses.Experts fear people may let down their guard.“I worry about the focus on vaccines, rather than what’s happening with the virus,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.It’s 30 Degrees.

	<title>Biden Sets in Motion Plan to Ban New Oil and Gas Leases on Federal Land</title>
	<author>Lisa Friedman</author>
	<body>[Live: follow our coverage of the Biden Administration]WASHINGTON — President Biden on Wednesday will direct federal agencies to determine how expansive a ban on new oil and gas leasing on federal land should be, part of a suite of executive orders that will effectively launch his agenda to combat climate change, two people with knowledge of the president’s plans said Monday. An eventual ban on new drilling leases would fulfill a campaign promise that infuriated the oil industry and became a central theme in the fight for the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, where the natural gas extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has become big business.The move is the most prominent of several that Mr. Biden will announce Wednesday, the two people said. The president also will direct the government to conserve 30 percent of all land and water by 2030, create a task force to assemble a governmentwide action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, issue a memorandum elevating climate change to a national security priority. Mr. Biden will also create several new commissions and positions within the government focused on environmental justice and environmentally friendly job creation, including one to help displaced coal communities.The programs and proclamations are supposed to signal that climate change is back on the government agenda, bigger than ever. What they will not deliver, at least yet, is a steep and rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.“Can this administration do a lot on its own? Yes,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. “But,” he added, “if the standard, though, is atmospheric stabilization, I’m skeptical the administration can do anything near enough administratively.”That will require legislation, Mr. Adler said, “especially if a premium is put on getting emissions reductions as soon as possible.”A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the orders, and two people close to the administration noted that final decisions on them were still being refined.The likelihood that Congress can pass vast parts of Mr. Biden’s $2 trillion climate change agenda is only slightly greater now that Democrats hold the slimmest possible majority in a 50-50 Senate. There is little hope of passing a carbon tax or other mechanism to put a price on greenhouse gas pollution, which would push cost-conscious corporations to emit less.Without legislation, the administration will have to rely on the regulatory process to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and smokestacks and improve vehicle fuel efficiency, but that takes time too. It cannot be done by executive order.“The tons of carbon pollution in the air is what matters in the end,” said Tim Profeta, director of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University and co-chairman of a group that delivered climate policy blueprints to the Biden administration.Mr. Profeta said the orders on Wednesday did represent an important first step.“The Biden administration can do quite a bit to start to put the country on the right trajectory with its own authorities,” Mr. Profeta said. Wednesday, he said, “starts the process.”The expected clampdown on new oil and gas leases goes further than Mr. Biden’s actions on Inauguration Day, which halted the Interior Department and other agencies’ authority to issue drilling leases or permits for 60 days while the administration reviewed the legal and policy implications of the current federal minerals leasing program.The new policy will call on agencies to consider how much federal land and waters should be preserved from mining and drilling or set aside for renewable energy production, according to the two people familiar with that order, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the policy publicly.The burning of fossil fuels extracted on public lands and waters accounted for almost a quarter of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions between 2005 and 2014, and Mr. Biden campaigned on ending new drilling as a key to tackling climate change.Much of the environmental community applauded the plan, though some said Mr. Biden is not going far enough.“It’s vital that President Biden permanently ban all new fossil fuel extraction, including fracking, on federal lands and waters,” said Mitch Jones, policy director for Food &amp; Water Watch, an environmental group.Throughout the campaign the left wing of Democratic Party pressed Mr. Biden to call for a national ban on fracking, including on private land, where most fracking is done. He refused, but the oil and gas industry remained skeptical. His move on Inauguration Day brought condemnation from the sector and some landowners.“Your order is a direct attack on our economy, sovereignty, and our right to self-determination,” the Ute Indian Tribe in Utah wrote to the Interior Department in a letter released by the American Petroleum Institute.The climate task force that Mr. Biden is expected to create will devise a plan for what administration officials like to call a “whole of government” approach to climate change, and will focus on two main areas: environmental justice and job creation.It will call for every agency to take climate change into consideration in government decisions, from federal procurement to financial regulations to lawsuit settlements, experts said.It also will create a number of councils and committees to try to ensure that poor and minority communities as well as Americans who live in coal country see the economic benefits of clean energy policies.Mr. Biden also is expected to revive and strengthen an Obama-era presidential memorandum in 2016 elevating climate change to a national security priority and requiring intelligence agencies to incorporate climate change into their analyses of national security threats. It was quickly revoked by the Trump administration.Alice Hill, who oversaw climate planning for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that direction from the president is necessary because the senior policymakers who request that analysis, and the intelligence officials who prepare it, often don’t have experience thinking about climate risks.“When I was in the White House, rarely were climate change risks discussed,” Ms. Hill said.She and others said Mr. Biden needed to go further, potentially by converting the memorandum into an executive order that has more authority to direct agencies to take steps like setting strategies and policies to deal with climate-related threats.“The climate reality of today is higher temperatures, stronger storms, more destructive wildfires, sea-level rise, acidifying oceans and extended drought,” said Sherri Goodman, a deputy under secretary of defense for environmental security under Obama and now a senior fellow at the Wilson Center’s Environmental Change and Security Program.“We need a climate security plan for America that climate-proofs American infrastructure and puts climate and clean energy innovation front and center,” she said.Christopher Flavelle contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>The first confirmed U.S. case of a variant discovered in Brazil is found in Minnesota.</title>
	<author>Apoorva Mandavilli</author>
	<body>A case of a more contagious coronavirus variant first found in Brazil has been confirmed in Minnesota, the state’s department of health said in a statement on Monday. It is the first confirmed case of the variant in the United States.The case was identified in a Minnesota resident who had recently traveled to Brazil, the department said, which could suggest that the variant may not yet be widely circulating.It was only a matter of time before the variant was detected in the United States, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a Covid adviser to President Biden. “With the world travel that you have, and the degree of transmissibility efficiency, it’s not surprising,” he said.The variant, known as B.1.1.28.1 or P.1, shares many mutations with one first identified in South Africa. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines still protect from the variant circulating in South Africa, the companies have said, but they are slightly less effective. They are expected to perform similarly against the variant identified in Brazil.The variant identified in Britain is more transmissible, but just as susceptible to vaccines as the original form of the virus. But the variants in Brazil and South Africa have additional mutations that may help elude the vaccines. “The amount of concern that I have between the U.K. variant, and the South African/Brazilian is much, much different,” Dr. Fauci said.The variant identified in Britain has been confirmed in 22 states, and the variant found in South Africa has not yet been confirmed in the United States. The P.1 variant is also thought to be more contagious but it is unclear if it causes more severe illness. The Minnesota Department of Health identified it through its variant surveillance program, which collects 50 random samples from laboratories in the state each week. Minnesota has one of the lowest daily caseloads relative to its population in the country, following a surge in the fall. The person with the confirmed case is a resident of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, the department said. The patient became ill during the first week of January and the specimen was collected Jan. 9, it said.Investigators from the health department had spoken with the person after the test was positive for the coronavirus, and the person had traveled to Brazil before becoming ill. The person was told to isolate and have household members quarantine. Health officials are conducting additional interviews with the person to learn more about the illness, travel and close contacts.The United States is flying blind, scientists have warned, as the country navigates the spread of the new variants without a large-scale, nationwide system for checking virus genomes for new mutations. Instead, the work of discovering the variants has fallen to a patchwork of academic, state and commercial laboratories. Scientists say that a national surveillance program would be able to determine just how widespread the new variant is and help contain emerging hot spots, extending the crucial window of time in which vulnerable people across the country could get vaccinated.The daily U.S. coronavirus caseload and number of hospitalized patients have fallen recent days, but the introduction of the variants into the country threatens to undermine that progress. The weekly average of new cases per day in the United States was down 33 percent on Sunday since two weeks prior, as states like California start to get a hold on their outbreaks. California officials on Monday announced that they were lifting severe coronavirus restrictions on large portions of the state, allowing outdoor dining and personal care businesses to resume limited operations. But the virus has for weeks been raging in Arizona, as well as South Carolina and Rhode Island. New York now has the fifth-worst outbreak in the country, though daily deaths from the virus are far from the levels seen there in the spring. President Biden’s press secretary said on Monday that he would extend the Trump administration’s ban on travel by noncitizens into the United States from Brazil, along with similar restrictions on Britain and 27 other European countries, where other variants have been identified. It also added South Africa to the list.Concern over the variants’ spread led to discussions in Europe of restricting nonessential travel. Proposing the new restrictions, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, tweeted that the new variants had “led us to take difficult but necessary decisions.” In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to announce an extension and tightening of lockdown rules in England this week amid growing concern.Experts point to Britain as a model for what the U.S. could do to monitor the variants. British researchers sequence the genome — that is, the complete genetic material in a coronavirus — from up to 10 percent of new positive samples. Even if the U.S. sequenced just 1 percent of genomes from across the country, or about 2,000 new samples a day, that would shine a bright light on the new variant, as well as other variants that may emerge.</body>

	<title>Taboola, Purveyor of Clickbait Ads, Will Go Public</title>
	<author>Tiffany Hsu</author>
	<body>Taboola, which serves up catchy clickbait links on websites, bet until four months ago that its future lay in merging with its chief rival.Now the company is opting for a different route: going public via Wall Street’s hottest trend.Taboola announced on Monday that it would merge with a so-called special-purpose acquisition company, a kind of publicly traded deal vehicle that has exploded in popularity.The deal, which values Taboola at about $2.6 billion and is backed by investors like the mutual fund giants Fidelity and BlackRock, sets up a new act for a company that occupies one of the most-mocked — and yet highly persistent — niches in online advertising. And it will help Taboola in what its chief executive, Adam Singolda, says is its mission: become a counterweight to digital ad giants like Google and Facebook.“We will have currency and access to cash to expand into new areas,” he said in an interview, adding that the current online ads landscape is “a huge market that’s fragmented.”Taboola runs what is known as a content recommendation platform, helping companies place “chumbox” ads on websites. Named for the angler’s practice of using chunks of dead fish to attract other fish, they often appear at the bottom of web pages as eye-catching thumbnail images promising links to listicles about cute puppies and testimonials such as “Top Doc: This Fruit Stops Weight Gain in Its Tracks.”The companies advertising through Taboola pay once viewers click on a link, and Taboola sends a portion of that revenue to the publishers that hosted the link, which include news organizations like CBS and CNBC. Mr. Singolda said that, in addition to driving tens of billions of clicks a year, Taboola helped publishers by attracting new audiences to their sites and offering insights into viewers’ behavior.But Taboola, like the rest of the ad industry, has faced concerns about inadvertently funding misinformation through ad spending. A recent report from Vice linked Taboola to unproven health remedies and sites known for advancing conspiracy theories.Mr. Singolda said Taboola did not allow political ads or links offering unsupported claims, but acknowledged that there were “a lot of issues” with coronavirus-related misinformation. He said the company employed more than 50 full-time content moderators manually reviewing half a million pages a week.“We’re not perfect — we make mistakes, and then we fix it,” he said.Taboola, which was started in Israel and is now based in New York, is profitable, according to Mr. Singolda, who said it collected a projected $1.2 billion in gross revenue last year — $379 million in net revenue, excluding payouts to publishers.In late 2019, Taboola saw a path to even greater growth in a merger with Outbrain, its chumbox archrival. That October, in a long-expected deal, the two announced plans to combine under the Taboola name.But within a year, both companies’ financial situations had changed. Antitrust regulators in Britain and Israel were still investigating the deal. The pandemic drew more viewers online but also forced websites to re-evaluate their spending and become “way more lean and mean,” Mr. Singolda said.The merger fell apart in September.But shortly afterward, Gilad Shany, an Israeli financier, raised nearly $259 million for ION Acquisition Corp 1, a SPAC that aimed to buy another Israeli business “to build a global player.”He and Mr. Singolda discussed a combination, which would take Taboola public by essentially giving it ION’s stock ticker. It is a quicker and surer way to bring companies to the public markets, which has helped make SPACs one of the finance industry’s biggest obsessions.Mr. Singolda said going public would give Taboola greater financial resources, notably the ability to sell publicly traded shares — which could help it make more acquisitions. (In addition to the ION fund’s money, Taboola has raised $285 million from Fidelity, BlackRock and others.)“We think this can be five times the size it is today,” said Mr. Shany, who will join Taboola’s board. “You don’t have to think that far to think that big.”</body>

	<title>As Biden Lifts a Ban, Transgender People Get a Long-Sought Chance to Enlist</title>
	<author>Dave Philipps</author>
	<body>LISBON, Ohio — Nic Talbott has wanted for years to be an Army intelligence officer. Instead, he has been a Walmart shelf stocker, an Amazon delivery driver, a substitute gym teacher and currently, a night-shift courier for a veterinary lab — all because he is transgender and therefore was banned from serving in the military.But as he has driven his shift through the dark hills of Appalachia, he has wondered if years of deferring his dreams might end after former President Donald J. Trump left office.“All I want is a chance,” he said.Mr. Talbott, 27, has been trying to join the military for much of his adult life. He has a college degree, top physical scores, a spotless record and everything else that would make him an enticing candidate. “The only thing keeping me from serving my country is one word on my medical record,” he said, shaking his head.That changed on Monday when President Biden signed an executive order reversing the ban on transgender troops that was imposed by the Trump administration. Mr. Biden’s order also called an immediate halt to involuntary discharges of transgender troops who were already serving, and for the Pentagon to review the files of any troops forced out under the ban in recent years. The order requires the secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to report on progress within 60 days.“Simply put, it’s the right thing to do, and is in our national interest,” the White House said in a statement.The president’s signature clears the way for a generation of young transgender Americans like Mr. Talbott who have spent years waiting out the ban, faithful that in a nation that is increasingly tolerant, the ban would be overturned in court or reversed by a new administration. That has often meant putting life on hold, delaying careers, education and other commitments.Because regulations created during the Obama administration can simply be reinstated, the move could mean that transgender recruits will be able to join within weeks, according to Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, a think tank that advocates for L.G.B.T.Q. policies in the military.“Basically, you just have to flip a switch,” Mr. Belkin said. He described Mr. Biden’s order as an overdue recognition that no one who can meet the standards should be barred from military service. “Today, those who believe in fact-based public policy and a strong, smart national defense have reason to be proud.”For would-be transgender soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, the change cannot come too soon. They have watched from the sidelines as a tug-of-war played out in Washington. In 2016, the Obama administration allowed people who had transitioned to a new gender to join the military, continuing a decades-long trend toward inclusion that stretched from the desegregation of the armed forces in 1948 to the repeal of the ban on openly gay troops in 2011. But in July 2017, before the new transgender policy could be fully put into place, Mr. Trump, under pressure from social conservatives, abruptly reimposed the ban through an announcement on Twitter. For a year, federal court injunctions kept the ban from being imposed, but in 2019 the Supreme Court allowed it to go forward.“For a lot of us, life has been on hold while all this is going on,” said Nicholas Ballou, a transgender man who scored 97 out of 100 on the military’s aptitude test and was about to enlist in the Army when the ban was imposed. He has spent the years since working at hardware stores and movie theaters. “It’s one thing to not be sure of your future when you’re 17,” he said. “When you’re 28, it doesn’t look so good any more.”Polling shows the public overwhelmingly opposes a ban on transgender people serving in the military.Even in the conservative corner of eastern Ohio where Mr. Talbott lives, and where Mr. Trump won nearly three-quarters of the vote in November, Mr. Talbott said he had faced little discrimination. Growing up as a girl, he played Star Wars and Call of Duty with a group of male friends who easily accepted him when he announced that he wanted to become a man. On the family’s small farm, where he helped out cutting hay and feeding cattle in a faded Carhartt field coat, his grandmother embraced his transition and his decision to join the military.Even in his small rural high school, where he returned to work as a substitute teacher until the coronavirus hit, he felt confident discussing his transition with students who found his yearbook photo.“It’s never been a big issue with anyone I know,” Mr. Talbott said. “It was just an issue with the president.”Mr. Talbott was forced out of the R.O.T.C. program at Kent State University last year and was told to turn in his uniform. On Monday morning, he said he planned to re-enroll next semester, and could not wait to put on his uniform again.“This is a moment I’ve been waiting for, for so many years,” he said. He said the excitement among scores of other prospective troops he had heard from is recent days was overwhelming. “We’ve been pushing for this for how many years? And we finally see the light. We are on deck and ready to go.”Though the military’s culture of conformity may seem like an unlikely draw for transgender young people, some who have struggled with gender identity see the armed forces as a haven where people are addressed by rank, not by gendered courtesy titles like Mr. and Ms.; where uniforms barely differentiate between men and women; and where the culture is often far less judgmental than the communities they leave behind.“My family, they won’t accept it,” said Leigh Maybe, a 19-year-old from a town of 3,000 in South Carolina. He enlisted in the Marines as a mechanic in 2017 as a way to start over, but was cut from the ranks before he could ship out to boot camp.“It just crushed me, I cried for hours,” he said. “That was my future.”In the years since, he has worked at a series of low-level jobs and waited, putting off starting testosterone treatments because he did not want anything to interfere with enlisting again. Now, with the policy reversed, he said, “I’ll join in a second.”Proponents of the ban argued that allowing transgender people to enlist would hurt national defense by saddling the military with troops who have costly medical needs and may not be deployable. But the leaders of all four military branches and the Coast Guard have said that the thousands of transgender military members now serving openly, who were grandfathered in under the Obama rules, have not had any adverse impact on operations.The ban may actually have hurt the military, a recent study by the Palm Center found, in part by depriving the armed forces of qualified, motivated people at a time when the services have struggled to meet recruiting goals.The estimated 200,000 transgender Americans of recruiting age includes James Wong, an engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University who, while in the Girl Scouts as a child, became an ace at survival skills, including starting a fire using only a flint and an ax.“I like leading people, I like solving problems, I want to serve my country,” Mr. Wong said in an interview from his home in Los Angeles, where he was taking courses remotely. “The military is a natural fit for me.”Mr. Wong, 20, initially considered applying to one of the United States service academies, but the ban kept him out. Instead he joined R.O.T.C., hoping that the policy would change by the time he graduated and could be commissioned as an officer. Before the virus ended classes, he woke up at 4:30 a.m. several times a week to go to physical training, but he knew that, under the ban, he would have to quit R.O.T.C. when it came time to take a military physical. Now he hopes to continue with R.O.T.C. this summer.“I’ve met all the standards,” he said. “None of the cadets or commanders have any issues with me.”When Mr. Trump announced the ban, many legal scholars thought it would eventually be found by courts to violate the constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. But the legal process has moved so slowly that it has effectively denied many young people an opportunity to join the military, according to Shannon Minter, a civil rights attorney and the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, who sued the Defense Department on behalf of Mr. Talbott and other transgender recruits.“It was a ban based on nothing but discrimination, and we all knew it would be struck down, but maybe not in time to help,” he said.Mr. Minter has spent years fighting Pentagon lawyers. Now that the Biden administration has reversed the regulation, his lawsuits are moot. But he added that the ban had an unlikely silver lining.“Before Trump’s ban, most people were completely unaware that transgender people were even in the military — they were caught up in stereotypes,” he said. “I think this has elevated the acceptance. It has forced people to realize there are really talented and committed transgender people that want to serve.”For Mr. Talbott, the years of delay and rejection have not changed his view of military service. In the past four years, he said, he has met dozens of recruiters, commanders and fellow cadets who supported him, which has given him faith that he can succeed.“I think, honestly, most of them aren’t interested in politics,” he said. “They only care if you can hack it. And that is all I care about, too. I want a chance to show we can do the job.”</body>

	<title>In Ice Age Siberia, a Meeting of Carnivores May Have Given Us Dogs</title>
	<author>James Gorman</author>
	<body>Twenty-three thousand years ago, in the cold of the last ice age, some humans found a place where the climate was marginally better: Siberia.While many people associate the region that is now in Russia with forbidding cold today, climate data as well as archaeological and DNA evidence show that this was where horses, mammoths and other prey animals found enough to eat, which attracted humans and other carnivores. Hemmed in by worse conditions, the humans, some of them the ancestors of Native Americans, were isolated for thousands of years. So were wolves.It is there and then that dogs were first domesticated, according to a new hypothesis from a group of archaeologists and ancient DNA experts who specialize in the deep history of humans and canines. They published their analysis on Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Angela R. Perri, an archaeologist at Durham University who studies the domestication of dogs, said the new hypothesis emerged in informal discussions among the authors. As they assembled archaeological and DNA data on the peopling of the Americas and the origins of dogs, they came up with an idea that was lurking in the data all along, one that she said, “I’m frankly embarrassed I didn’t have earlier.”David Meltzer, another author who is an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas specializing in the peopling of the Americas, recalled one whiteboard session at Oxford in which he and other authors, including Dr. Perri, brainstormed the complicated chain of reasoning based on DNA evidence that has allowed the tracing of population movement of ancient humans and more recently dogs.He said to Greger Larson, an Oxford scientist who has orchestrated a number of dog domestication studies, including this one: “I’ve seen your dog dates. And my people dates, they kind of look the same.” By the time the whiteboard was filled, he said, they had the bones of the new paper.Ancient canine history is murky and in the past decade alone, researchers have suggested Europe, Eurasia, East Asia and Africa as the first home of dogs, starting at least 15,000 years ago. Some researchers push the origin back much further, but whether some of the earliest fossils are dogs or wolves is debated.A starting point for the new proposal is the date when humans first came to the Americas, probably around 15,000 years ago. Another is that ancient DNA shows that dog and human populations have similar histories of migration and divergence.Dr. Perri said that among ancient American dogs, which disappeared, leaving only traces of their genetics in a few modern breeds, “there are two main groups which share a common ancestor about 23,000 years ago.”On the human side there is a similar split.The names get a bit hard to keep track of, but one group called the Ancient North Siberians mixed with another group from which Ancestral Native Americans split about 21,000 years ago. The hypothesis suggests that in addition to providing some genes, the ancient North Siberians also gave dogs to people, some of whom eventually migrated to North America, taking the dogs with them. As Dr. Meltzer said, “Dogs are not going to go to the new world without people.”But the several different groups in Siberia appear to have been isolated from outside contact from about 30,000 years ago to 15,000 years ago. So, Dr. Perri said, if there is “this isolated population who had no interaction with anyone outside of Siberia after 30,000 years ago, who gave the dogs to the ancestors of Native Americans?”The data suggest that it was the ancient North Siberians, who, having been isolated for thousands of years, must have been the people who first domesticated wolves, or with whom wolves domesticated themselves, feeding on leftovers or discards from the hunt.Dr. Meltzer said these Siberians lived in small groups of 25 or so in a vast, open landscape. Ancient DNA evidence shows that they married outside of their small groups, and so had to seek one another out. “People are exchanging information, they’re exchanging mates, they’re maybe exchanging their wolf pups,” he said.Pontus Skoglund, an ancient DNA expert who studies the origin of dogs at the Crick Institute in London and was not involved in the research, said, “Siberia could very well be the origin of dogs. Absolutely.” But, he said this was one possibility only. He said the analysis in the paper depended largely on mitochondrial DNA, which traces only the maternal line and is therefore incomplete.“It’s still an open question for me,” he said. “It could be many other corners of Eurasia as well.”New information on ancient DNA recovered from Siberian dog fossils that are 18,000 or more years old could help prove or disprove the hypothesis, Dr. Perri said, and she and her colleagues are working on those studies now.</body>

	<title>$1.2 Million Homes in California</title>
	<author>Angela Serratore</author>
	<body>This townhouse is in a new four-unit complex called The Sheds, designed by Horst Architects. Set between the campuses of Laguna College of Art and Design (about five minutes from each campus on foot), the units are meant to evoke the live-work style of artists’ lofts, with multiple balconies and open floor plans that allow for flexible use. The property is tucked into the base of Laguna Canyon, close to hiking trails, and is a five-minute drive from the Pacific Ocean and the Laguna beaches, as well as the upscale dining and shopping of downtown Laguna Beach.Size: 1,277 square feetPrice per square foot: $939Indoors: A private entrance leads from the carport to the inside of this unit, where stairs rise from the ground level to the main living area. The ceilings are high, and double-height windows bring in sunlight and canyon views.The sitting area faces a set of sliding-glass doors that open to a balcony. The hardwood floors are wide-plank and continue into a galley-style kitchen divided from the sitting area by an island with room for seating. The appliances are stainless steel, and the countertops are quartz. The cabinets are white and finished with brushed-metal hardware.Just off the kitchen is a bedroom with built-in closets. On the other side of the kitchen is a full bathroom with more built-in cabinets and a windowed tub-and-shower combination finished with slate-colored tiles.Stairs with a brushed-metal railing lead to the lofted second floor, where an open space overlooks the lower level. A narrow space at the front of the unit is currently used as a second sitting area, and has access to a balcony. Farther back, a wider space easily holds a dining table and chairs.A second bedroom, roughly the same size as the one downstairs, is off the back of this level, as is a second full bathroom.Outdoor space: The unit has two balconies, one off each of the two living areas. The lower balcony has space for a table and chairs, plus a small outdoor sofa, and is shaded by the roof overhang and the balcony above it. The upper balcony is smaller, but still has space for seating, and gets a bit more sun than the one downstairs. Two dedicated parking spots in the covered carport are assigned to this unit.Taxes: $14,268 (estimated), plus a $260 monthly homeowner association feeContact: Ann E. Metzger, the Agency, 949-698-2082; theagencyre.comThis shingled building occupies a corner lot in a quiet neighborhood between the Castro and Noe Valley. The unit is on the ground floor and retains many original details, including crown molding in the living areas and bedrooms. A Whole Foods Market is 10 minutes away on foot, as is Noe Valley Courts park, which has a lawn, basketball court and tennis courts. Golden Gate Park is a 10-minute drive; the financial district is 20 minutes away.Size: 1,103 square feetPrice per square foot: $1,043Indoors: The front door, topped with a transom window, opens into a long hallway that leads to the kitchen, at the back of the unit.To the immediate left is a living room with refinished oak floors and high ceilings. The light fixtures are new, and the crown moldings are original. Large windows face the street.Pocket doors separate the living room — probably once used as a parlor — from the primary bedroom, which also has a door connecting it to the main hallway. A closet with an original crystal doorknob is built into one wall, and the space is large enough to hold a king-size bed. Another door leads from this bedroom to a guest room, which is also accessible from the main hallway and has a built-in closet and a set of free-standing closets.Tucked into the hall, across from the living room, is a nook that the sellers use as an office space, with room for a desk and chair. A few paces down is a split bathroom: One room holds a porcelain pedestal sink and a combination tub and shower; the one next door holds a toilet and a second sink.The kitchen at the end of the hall was updated a little more than a decade years ago; previous owners tore out a laundry closet to expand the space. The appliances are stainless steel, and there is enough room for a dining table and chairs. A small laundry closet, with a new washer and dryer, is tucked into one corner.Outdoor space: Many corner buildings take advantage of the lot size to build out as far as possible, eschewing outdoor space, as is the case here. Street parking is plentiful in the neighborhood, and a convenient bus route — the fleet is electric, minimizing noise — stops directly across the street.Taxes: $14,028 (estimated), plus a $300 monthly homeowner association feeContact: Steve Gallagher, Coldwell Banker, 415-437-4524; coldwellbankerhomes.comA few early 20th-century stone cottages are scattered around Burbank; this one, in the Burbank Hills neighborhood, is a mix of old and new, with original rock-wall remnants in several spaces and an updated primary bedroom suite in a second-level addition.The trailhead at Wildwood Canyon, a popular hiking spot, is about a five-minute drive from the property.

	<title>Kim Jones Wants to Rule the Fashion World</title>
	<author>Vanessa Friedman</author>
	<body>Kim Jones, the British designer, is many things.He is among the most celebrated men’s wear talents of his generation. He is a five-time winner of various British fashion awards, for men’s wear designer of the year, Trailblazer and Creativity, and he has received the Order of the British Empire. He is the former head of his own label, as well as Dunhill and Louis Vuitton men’s wear, and is the current head of Dior men’s wear. (He is the guy who got Vuitton to collaborate with Supreme, and Dior with Air Jordan.)He is BFF with Kate Moss. He is a collector of rare books (about 20,000), rare vintage clubbing wear (early pieces from Vivienne Westwood and Leigh Bowery) and rare vinyl (around 6,000 records). He is a peripatetic child of Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. He is all that.What he has not been, however, is a women’s wear designer. He did not study women’s wear at Central Saint Martins, and, at 41, has never made a full women’s collection.Yet last September, the executives at LVMH named Mr. Jones the artistic director of women’s wear for Fendi, the position held for 54 years by Karl Lagerfeld, the most prolific, provocative and omnivorously cultured designer of the 20th and early 21st century, one of the few who transcended fashion to become practically a piece of pop art unto himself.What were they thinking? This week, as Mr. Jones introduces his debut couture show for Fendi, everyone will find out.“It’s quite a challenge,” said Antoine Arnault, the LVMH group head of communications and chief executive of Berluti, another LVMH men’s brand, who has known Mr. Jones since they worked together at Vuitton. But, he said, Mr. Jones is “one of our superstars.” Then he used words like “mysterious” and “unexplained drive” before finally settling on a soccer metaphor.“When you have a top footballer on your team,” Mr. Arnault said, “you want to let him play to to his full potential.”Mr. Jones is not the first designer to make the jump from men’s to women’s wear — Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, Raf Simons and Hedi Slimane did it before him — but given that Fendi surpassed a billion euros in revenue in 2017 (about $1.2 billion) to become one of the more important brands in the LVMH stable, a lot is riding on his success.In addition, Mr. Jones remains the artistic director of Dior men’s wear, which means he is not only stepping into Mr. Lagerfeld’s shoes at Fendi, but also, like Mr. Lagerfeld, he will be the only designer at the top of two global luxury heritage brands, responsible for at least 12 collections a year, a balancing act that has long been seen as a handicap to creativity.Still, said Marios Schwab, who designed a women’s collection in 2003 for Mr. Jones’s namesake label, he has long been “majorly ambitious.” He did, after all, close his own label with very little tsuris after he landed the bigger jobs, swapping independence for the corporate superstructure of power, budgets and reach. As he told British Vogue when he joined Vuitton: “Why would I want to do my own label when I can do fantastic things here and put my spin on things?” Then he added, “You can’t be that naïve about the world, you have to get on with stuff.”Besides, said Jefferson Hack, a founder of Dazed Media, who has known and chronicled Mr. Jones since college: “Kim’s vision has always been very gender nonspecific. Though he has a strong point of view on the new masculinity, he has also been good at making pieces from his collections appeal to female desire.”Not that Mr. Jones himself seems particularly worried. Like Mr. Lagerfeld, he has both a healthy sense of his own talent and an equally healthy lack of neuroses about the size of his job.“I think I’ve achieved quite a few good things in my career, and this is the next step,” he said, speaking from the study of his house in West London a few weeks before the Fendi show, which will not exactly be a humble, finding-his-feet debut. Rather, it will be a go-big-or-go-splat bid with a cast that included Demi Moore, Kate and Lila Moss, Naomi Campbell, Bella Hadid, Adwoa Aboah and Christy and James Turlington posed in different vignettes amid a maze of glass boxes in the Palais Brongniart, the former French stock exchange.Though Mr. Jones used to have an apartment in Paris, he had given up the lease when he got the Fendi job, to reduce distractions. Instead, he stays in the same room in the same hotel every time he goes to Paris or Rome, kind of the way Mark Zuckerberg wears the same thing every day so he doesn’t have to think about it.“The biggest honor you can get is to be offered the job Karl Lagerfeld did,” Mr. Jones said. Even if it is also the most dangerous because of the comparisons invited.As he talked, Mr. Jones was wearing a black Loro Piana vicuña knit he said had been a Christmas present. (The brand is also owned by LVMH.) Over Christmas, his normally brown hair had been dyed platinum blond, and he had lost about 33 pounds during lockdown, thanks to having an indoor pool and being home enough to actually have a routine.He was sitting in front of a wall of shelves that housed his collection of rare books, including an uncorrected proof of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” a first edition of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” original lyrics by the Velvet Underground and nine versions of “Orlando” by Virginia Woolf. Among them was one that Woolf had inscribed to Vita Sackville-West, her lover; one owned by Noël Coward; and another owned by John Maynard Keynes. The positioning was not a coincidence.Mr. Jones’s couture show was inspired by “Orlando” and the whole Bloomsbury set, who may have hung out in the English countryside but also had a love affair with Rome (which is, of course, where Fendi was founded). He is fully aware that this may seem a hackneyed choice for a debut, given that Bloomsbury is one of the most overused references in fashion, having inspired such designers as John Galliano, Christopher Bailey and Rei Kawakubo, but in stationing himself in front of his books, he was making an implicit argument about his right to the subject. As well as his understanding of his new job.“Couture,” Mr. Jones said, “is very personal.” It is, after all, about garments made to order, for a single person. “Orlando” was demonstrably very personal to him. Hence couture equals “Orlando.”And, Bloomsbury was all about strong, intellectual women, and Mr. Jones thought that Fendi, which became famous as a matriarchy, was also all about strong, intellectual women. And, gender fluidity is now part of the cultural conversation, as is the whole concept of time, and both are core to “Orlando.”It was a classic Jones move and is one of the reasons LVMH has so much faith in him: He sees all the pieces on his board. Also, he is unabashed in his delight in creating “hits” — products that go viral — and in his almost scientific interest in plumbing archives and brand iconography for ideas, an approach that has been termed “commercial biology.”“I’m a Virgo Virgo,” Mr. Jones said. As it happens, Mr. Lagerfeld’s birthday was the day before Mr. Jones’s birthday. A superstitious person may think this was a telling detail. Mr. Jones prefers to keep it more granular.“I’ll read about him and think: ‘I did that, I do that,’” Mr. Jones said of Mr. Lagerfeld. “Except I arrive at 9 and leave at 7, and he would come very late and keep everyone waiting all night.”Though his appointment at Fendi is relatively new — he has officially been there only just over 14 weeks — the move was first mooted a couple of years ago when he started to get antsy at Vuitton, and in men’s wear. Men’s clothing may be a growing sector, but women’s wear remains the glamour side of the business: The shows are bigger, as are the collections, celebrities and budgets.Rumors had reached a fever pitch that Mr. Jones was going to join Donatella Versace at Versace, to become her heir. Instead, he played his chess pieces like a grandmaster and ended up moving to Dior, with the suggestion, it was rumored, of more to come. Indeed, it was during those earlier negotiations, Mr. Jones said, that Silvia Venturini Fendi (the Fendi family member still involved in the business, and the head of men’s and accessories) broached the idea of him coming to Fendi to work on the women’s line.“It was on the mind of everyone who decides here as soon as we saw how much work power he had and how much his collections touched the right audience,” Mr. Arnault said. Mr. Jones put an Easter egg of sorts in his final Vuitton men’s collection with guest appearances by Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell in shiny LV trench coats (his female friends had always worn pieces from his men’s collections). And at Dior, he delved into the couture archives to add a touch of feminine opulence to his men’s wear.As far as Mr. Jones is concerned, it is navigating the multitude of choices in women’s wear that is the biggest learning curve. “All the embroideries and techniques are a little overwhelming,” he said, noting that when he arrived at the Fendi atelier, he had to ask the staff to leave for 10 minutes so he could go through them by himself.For a reality check he has a group of women around him, including Ms. Moss, who consulted on accessories; the stylist Melanie Ward; the art director Ronnie Cooke Newhouse; and, most of all, Ms. Fendi and her daughter, Delfina.“We both surround ourselves with people and objects that inspire us, and draw upon our own lives and passions to fuel our creative process,” Ms. Fendi said of Mr. Jones in an email. She added that as with Mr. Lagerfeld: “Kim and I exchange ideas spontaneously via text or chat, as there are no boundaries to our jobs. We see something that might inspire us and share it with the other.”Though Mr. Jones made his name at Vuitton and Dior in part by his ability to meld the tropes of street wear and the runway and his embrace of collaborations, those who expect him to reprise those skills, but in women’s wear, will be disappointed. There are no haute sneakers or hoodies in the couture, no work from guest artists. Rather, there are Bernini marble prints and elaborate brocade, pearl-speckled chiffon and rose-festooned silks.The collection is a consciously eclectic mélange of androgyny and reference, including a nod to Mr. Lagerfeld, with a half-suit, half-evening-gown look inspired by a sketch of his from 1993. Also, there are a lot of capes.You can understand why Mr. Jones might have mantles on the mind. And they do look good on everyone.</body>

	<title>Republicans’ Trump Dilemma</title>
	<author>Giovanni Russonello</author>
	<body>Without his Twitter account, former President Donald Trump has lost his preferred method of communication with the public, and his favorite anger-management tool. His allies in the Republican Party, however, may have just lost a major liability.Republicans have begun to put the Senate impeachment trial itself on trial, striding past the question of whether Trump committed impeachable offenses when he incited a riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. On the talk shows on Sunday, a number of Republican senators said they thought it would be moot — and maybe unconstitutional — to impeach a president after he left office.Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota called impeachment a “moot point” on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Because I think right now Donald Trump is no longer the president,” he said. “He is a former president.”A major asset to the forget-about-it defense has been the silent serenity of Trump himself, who has hardly been heard from since retreating to Florida last week. He left office with the reliable support of roughly eight in 10 Republicans nationwide, and in the days since then he has begun to recede, with a startling quietude, into figurehead status.The party is racked by internal divisions and soul-searching — all of which is now being funneled into the question of whether to convict Trump in the Senate and leave him for dead, or acquit him and leave the door open for him to re-enter the political fray. But it’s happening in the opposite context from the events that got him impeached: Trump is no longer president, and he’s no longer on Twitter.Even most of Trump’s supporters consistently said in polls that they wished he would set fires on Twitter less often. And it is his public statements — including those he made on the social media platform — that prompted this impeachment in the first place. “When I did polls and focus groups with Trump voters, they would say time and time again: They wished he would stop tweeting so much,” said Glen Bolger, a longtime Republican pollster.“There is certainly something to be said for a little bit of a pressure valve loosened, if he’s not tweeting stupid things every day,” Bolger said of Republican senators who are deciding how to vote on impeachment. “I think the bigger factor that they’ll be thinking about is, what are the implications in terms of me being primaried by someone?”Trump’s effect on the shape of the Republican base has been powerful; the question now is whether it will be long-lasting.By the end of his term, Trump had hit record-low approval, including a significant dent in popularity among Republican voters. But he still commands support from a wide majority of the G.O.P. And the bloc of voters identifying as Republicans has significantly shifted to accommodate him: toward white people without college degrees, and away from the affluent white suburbanites who were crucial to the party for so long.On CNN’s “State of the Union” yesterday, Senator Mitt Romney became the first Republican in the chamber to publicly say he approved of the House’s decision to impeach Trump, and also batted down President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion economic recovery package. In a way, this was another rejection of Trumpism.Trump left office this month pushing for $2,000 stimulus checks, which still haven’t been passed. Part of his legacy will be defining a kind of populist Republicanism that sought to project a willingness to stand up for working people.His weaponization of racial anxiety is another part of his legacy: On his way out of office, Trump’s 1776 Commission released a report that amounted to a wholesale reframing of the nation’s history, minimizing the role of slavery and calling for a “patriotic education” for schoolchildren.As the G.O.P. gets into formation against a coming wave of proposals from Biden’s White House, its leaders will be defining their relationship to Trump’s legacy on multiple fronts. Vote to impeach, and risk showing disloyalty to the figurehead. Waver in support for his ethnonationalist politics, and stand accused of participating in “cancel culture.”But vote to oppose aid to families that Trump called for, and risk sinking back into Romneyite Republicanism circa 2012 — a gambit that simply may not be feasible for the party anymore.On Politics is also available as a newsletter.

	<title>The Metropolitan Opera Hires Its First Chief Diversity Officer</title>
	<author>Joshua Barone</author>
	<body>Marcia Sells — a former dancer who became an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn and the dean of students at Harvard Law School — has been hired as the first chief diversity officer of the Metropolitan Opera, the largest performing arts institution in the United States.Her appointment, which the Met announced on Monday, is something of a corrective to the company’s nearly 140-year history and a response to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that followed the killing of George Floyd in 2020. It’s also a conscious step toward inclusivity by a major player in an industry in which some Black singers, including Leontyne Price and Jessye Norman, have found stardom, but diversity has lagged in orchestras, staff and leadership.Since last summer, cultural institutions across the country have made changes as the Black Lives Matter movement drew scrutiny to racial inequities in virtually every corner of the arts world. The Met was no exception: The company announced plans to open next season with Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” its first opera by a Black composer, directed by James Robinson and Camille A. Brown, who will become the first Black director to lead a production on the Met’s main stage. It also named three composers of color — Valerie Coleman, Jessie Montgomery and Joel Thompson — to its commissioning program.But to make broader changes at the Met, an institution with a long payroll and a budget in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the Met is turning to Ms. Sells. As a member of the senior management team, she will report to Peter Gelb, the general manager. The human resources department will be brought under her direction, and her purview will be broad: the Met in its entirety, including the board.“Sometimes horrible events like the killing of George Floyd catalyze people, and they realize this is something we need to do — at the Met and across the arts,” Ms. Sells said in an interview about her plans to make the Met a more inclusive company that values the diversity of its staff and the audiences it serves.Mr. Gelb described Ms. Sells as an “ideal” candidate. “Not only does she have a history of accomplishment, but she also has a knowledge of the performing arts, having been involved in them herself,” he said in an interview. “And she loves opera, which is definitely a plus.”Ms. Sells began dancing as a 4-year-old in Cincinnati, an arts-rich city where she found herself both onstage and in the audience of the storied Music Hall, and where she saw a young Kathleen Battle sing as a student at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music.“It had been part of my growing up to experience art,” she said.She later joined Arthur Mitchell’s company, Dance Theater of Harlem, then remained in New York to attend Barnard College and Columbia Law School. Ms. Sells described herself as “an affirmative action baby,” and said that as both a dancer and a law student she had encountered racism, both overt and insidious, that made her feel unwelcome.Ms. Sells recalled, for instance, a judge in the mid-1980s who told her that witnesses had to wait outside the courtroom. She said that she was actually an assistant district attorney, and he replied, “Wow, things have changed.”Diversity has been at the fore of her work as an administrator — at places including Columbia, the N.B.A. and eventually Harvard Law, where she has been the dean of students since 2015. Her mandate at the Met won’t be too far from that of Harvard, another institute often perceived as elite to the point of exclusivity.“It’s not just that you want to get it right,” Ms. Sells said. “There are a lot of eyes on you, but it’s a huge opportunity to show the way, as well as learn from other organizations that don’t have as big a name, are not as well known, and help shine a light on that work and on them.”She plans to start at the Met in late February. Among her early tasks will be to conceive a diversity, equity and inclusion plan that could be implemented across hiring, artistic planning and engagement; she will also examine structural inequities at the Met, and work with the marketing and development departments to broaden the company’s audience and donor base.The Met has been shut down because of the pandemic since last March, and most of its workers have been furloughed without pay since April. It is facing a major labor dispute with its unions, as well as more than $150 million in lost revenue from the theater’s closure. But Mr. Gelb said that the company hopes to receive assistance for diversity-related costs from foundations.What those costs are will become clearer as Ms. Sells settles into her new job. She said that she was ready, and motivated by the company’s recent recognition “of how structurally or historically the Met has not felt welcoming to people of color” and the range of possibilities for change.“I truly believe,” Ms. Sells said, “that this is the Met’s moment.”</body>

	<title>Supreme Court Ends Emoluments Suits Against Trump</title>
	<author>Adam Liptak</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday put an end to two lawsuits that had accused President Donald J. Trump of violating the Constitution’s emoluments clauses by profiting from his hotels and restaurants in New York and Washington.In brief orders, the court wiped out rulings against Mr. Trump in the two cases and dismissed them as moot. There were no dissents noted.The move means that there will be no definitive Supreme Court ruling on the meaning of the two provisions of the Constitution concerning emoluments, a term that means compensation for labor or services. One provision, the domestic emoluments clause, bars the president from receiving “any other emolument” from the federal government or the states beyond his official compensation.The other provision, the foreign emoluments clause, bars anyone holding a federal “office of profit or trust” from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state” without the consent of Congress.Federal appeals courts in New York and Virginia ruled against Mr. Trump on the preliminary issue of whether the plaintiffs were entitled to sue the president.The New York case was brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which represented competitors of Mr. Trump’s businesses that said they had been disadvantaged by the payments he received.Noah Bookbinder, the group’s executive director, said the lawsuit had served a valuable purpose.“This important litigation made the American people aware for four years of the pervasive corruption that came from a president maintaining a global business and taking benefits and payments from foreign and domestic governments,” Mr. Bookbinder said in a statement. “Only Trump losing the presidency and leaving office ended these corrupt constitutional violations” and stopped the lawsuits.The other case was brought by Maryland and the District of Columbia, which accused Mr. Trump of violating the Constitution by profiting from his Washington hotel.In a joint statement, Brian E. Frosh, Maryland’s attorney general, and Karl A. Racine, the District of Columbia’s attorney general, said they had sought to prove that “President Trump illegally profited from his office by receiving improper emoluments in the form of money from foreign governments, federal agencies and state governments that conducted business at his hotel to curry favor with him and his administration.”“History will note that at every step of this case, President Trump and political appointees at the Department of Justice went to extreme lengths to prevent us from uncovering the true extent of his corruption,” the statement said. “He attempted to short-circuit the rules of legal procedure to have our case dismissed and avoid discovery into his finances, arguing that the law did not apply to him.”A third emoluments lawsuit, brought by Democratic members of Congress, was dismissed in February by a federal appeals court in Washington. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.</body>

	<title>The Site Trump Could Run To Next</title>
	<author>‘Sway’</author>
	<body>Produced by ‘Sway’Facebook and Twitter have kicked Donald Trump off their platforms and Amazon Web Services removed Parler from its cloud. But there’s another popular platform that markets itself as the destination for free speech: Substack.[You can listen to this episode of “Sway” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]With more than 250,000 unique individuals paying for the newsletters on its platform, Substack is a lot smaller than Twitter or Facebook. Still, it’s a rapidly growing space for big media personalities who want to reach their audience directly. Glenn Greenwald, Andrew Sullivan, Hunter Harris and Anne Helen Petersen have all left their legacy media publications to start their own Substack newsletters. So should media companies be worried about the competition?On this episode of “Sway,” Kara Swisher speaks to Chris Best, the chief executive and a co-founder of Substack, about content moderation on his platform and asks whether Substack is going to destroy media gatekeepers or just turn into one of them.(A full transcript of the episode will be available midday on the Times website.)Thoughts? Email us at sway@nytimes.com.“Sway” is produced by Nayeema Raza, Heba Elorbany, Matt Kwong and Vishakha Darbha, and edited by Paula Szuchman; with fact-checking by Kate Sinclair, music and sound design by Isaac Jones, and mixing by Erick Gomez.

	<title>Sarah Huckabee Sanders will run for governor of Arkansas.</title>
	<author>Maggie Haberman</author>
	<body>Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as a White House press secretary under former President Donald J. Trump, announced her candidacy for governor of Arkansas on Monday, running for a seat her father, Mike Huckabee, once held.Ms. Sanders is seen as Mr. Trump’s preferred candidate for the election, which will be held in 2022, and her candidacy will serve, to some extent, as a test of Mr. Trump’s remaining strength in the Republican Party. The party has found itself divided after the tumultuous final weeks of Mr. Trump’s presidency, his false claims of widespread voter fraud and his role in igniting a riot by his supporters at the Capitol on Jan. 6.She announced her run in a video posted on her website Monday morning.</body>

	<title>Your Monday Briefing</title>
	<author>Natasha Frost</author>
	<body>(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.We’re covering growing concerns about the new variants of the coronavirus, the threat of the global far right and the deadly art of lobster diving.Britain’s disclosure Friday that a new variant of the virus could be deadlier than the original has silenced those who had been calling for a swift return to life as it once was.The British government is expected to announce in coming days that it will prolong and tighten the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson this month. Schools may stay closed until Easter, while travelers arriving from overseas could be required to quarantine in hotels for 10 days.For Mr. Johnson, who has faced unrelenting pressure from members of his own Conservative Party to begin easing restrictions, the warning about the variant was a powerful argument that Britain could be in the middle of a severe new phase of the pandemic — and that relaxing restrictions now could be calamitous.Repercussions: While scientists agree that evidence of the variant’s greater lethality is preliminary, they said it nonetheless served the government’s purposes in the debate over lockdowns, in which Mr. Johnson, pulled between science and politics, has often shown an aversion to taking hard steps.Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.In other developments:Larry King, who interviewed presidents, movie stars and people from all walks of life, died on Saturday in Los Angeles at the age of 87. He had recently been treated for Covid-19.Israel will halt most air travel in and out of the country for at least a week starting from midnight on Monday, in an effort to block the invasion of emerging variants.Egypt began vaccinating health care workers at isolation facilities, pulmonology hospitals and fever wards on Sunday, in the first wave of the country’s vaccine rollout.Demonstrators in the Netherlands clashed with the police in two cities on Sunday, and a coronavirus testing facility was burned on Saturday, as anger at a nationwide lockdown grew more violent.The European Union said that it would take legal action if necessary to ensure pharmaceutical companies fulfilled contracts to supply vaccines to the bloc, after manufacturers announced possible delays.United around the world by racist ideology that has been supercharged by social media, some far-right extremists have been galvanized by the events of Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol.Though many online disavowed the storming of the Capitol as amateurish bungling, others saw it as a teaching moment — about how to pursue their goal of overturning democratic governments in more concerted and concrete ways.It is difficult to say exactly how deep and durable the links are between the American far right and its European counterparts. But officials are increasingly concerned about a web of diffuse international links, and worry that the networks, already emboldened in the Trump era, have become more determined in recent weeks.Germany: After the violence in the U.S., the authorities in Germany tightened security around the Parliament building in Berlin, where far-right protesters — waving many of the same flags and symbols as the rioters in Washington — had tried to force their way in on Aug. 29. For now, no concrete plans for attacks have been detected in Germany, officials said.As the world approaches 100 million coronavirus cases — including 25 million in the U.S. as of Saturday, and nearly 30 million in Europe — questions are surfacing about new variants of the virus that could slow or even reverse the progress that has been made toward ending the pandemic, as well as about the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world.One of those questions is how effective the current vaccines will be against these altered versions of the virus, which initially appeared in Britain, South Africa, Brazil and the U.S. Some appear to be more contagious than the original version, and all are little understood.At the same time, failing to distribute Covid-19 vaccines to poor countries is likely to cause global economic devastation, in which affluent countries will be hit nearly as hard as those in the developing world, according to a new study commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce to be released today.By the numbers: In the most extreme scenario — with wealthy nations fully vaccinated by the middle of this year, and poor countries largely shut out — the study concludes that the global economy would suffer losses exceeding $9 trillion, a sum greater than the annual output of Japan and Germany combined.Along the impoverished northeast Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, the mostly Indigenous population depends on fishing — and high-priced spiny lobster is among the most sought-after quarry.But lobstering there is a stunningly dangerous pursuit. Hundreds of fishermen have been paralyzed in the chase for lobsters and other delicacies like conch and sea cucumbers found deep in the ocean.Trump impeachment trial: The House of Representatives will deliver its impeachment charge against former President Donald Trump to the Senate today, but the trial will not begin before Feb. 8.Asia’s “El Chapo”: Tse Chi Lop, said to be the leader of a multibillion-dollar drug syndicate, was arrested in Amsterdam on Friday and faces extradition to Australia.Chinese miners: Two weeks after an explosion left a group of miners trapped below ground in Shandong Province, at least 11 were found alive and lifted to the surface on Sunday.“Cocorico!”: After a series of high-profile disputes in rural areas, the French Parliament has passed a bill that enshrines the smells and sounds of the countryside, however odoriferous or vociferous, as protected national heritage.Snapshot: Above, supporters of the jailed opposition leader Aleksei Navalny in Moscow on Saturday hold banners that read, “Don’t be afraid. Don’t be silent,” and “One for all and all for one.” There were demonstrations in more than 100 cities on Saturday, the biggest protests in Russia since at least 2017. Analysts say the standoff between the Kremlin and its critics seems poised to intensify.Cosmic lost and found: Missing: one very, very large black hole. One of the biggest galaxies in the universe seems to lack its dark centerpiece — and despite astronomers’ best efforts, they’re no closer to finding it.“This was for Nepal”: A group of climbers from Nepal earlier this month became the first people in the world to summit K2 in winter, a mountaineering challenge that had been believed by many to be impossible.What we’re reading: This GQ piece by Douglas Emhoff, about his role as the first “second gentleman.” It’s an interesting read about reinventing yourself.Cook: This hearty vegetarian lasagna with spinach and herby ricotta uses layers of Parmesan-topped baked polenta in place of pasta.Knit: Crafters in search of Harry Styles’s colorful cardigan and Bernie Sanders’s inauguration mittens are reverse-engineering their own patterns.Watch: Revisit — or perhaps enjoy for the first time — five movies that define the romantic comedies of the 1980s.You can stay safe while making time for yourself. At Home has our full collection of ideas on what to read, cook, watch, and do while staying indoors.With reporter-staffed bureaus in some 30 countries, The Times can report quickly on breaking news happening almost anywhere. Our three main hubs of newsroom operations — New York, London and an Asia hub that has been in Hong Kong but is moving to Seoul — are at the center of that effort. Here’s a glimpse at how it works.At the end of the workday in New York, editors will hand off coverage to editors in Hong Kong and Seoul, who are currently 13 and 14 hours ahead on the clock. As editors in Asia wind down their day, a waking London newsroom will take over as the primary hub. Several hours later, that team will pass the baton back to New York, and it all repeats again, a rotation that is critical for a 24-hour news operation.“There’s a lot of overlap,” said Adrienne Carter, The Times’s Asia editor, “so there’s probably only a handful of hours where any one group is on its own.”When Asia hands off coverage to London, a newsroom of about 70 staff members must keep watch on four continents. The journalists start the newsroom’s coverage of Europe, Africa and the Middle East, while often also coordinating news early in the U.S. morning with the International, National and Science desks, as well as the Washington bureau.Jim Yardley, the Europe editor, said that the way the international newsrooms are structured helps makes the joint effort seamless. “One of the things about London and Hong Kong is that, primarily, they are outgrowths of the International desk, but they are part of every desk in many ways,” he said. “It’s an attempt to actually make the work more collaborative and less siloed.”That’s it for this briefing.

	<title>I’ve Said Goodbye to ‘Normal.’ You Should, Too.</title>
	<author>Roy Scranton</author>
	<body>The other night, I went to pick up takeout at a local Irish pub. It was a gray and rainy evening at the end of a long week, and my partner and I were suffering from Zoom fatigue. We love this pub not just because it has good food, but because it’s a living part of our community. Pre-Covid, they used to have Irish traditional music sessions, and any cold and snowy night you’d be greeted with a burst of cheer, a packed house, friends and families all out for a cozy good time.Now it’s a ghostly quiet. Social distancing rules mean that even at max capacity, it still only has a tiny fraction of its usual clientele. Standing in that empty pub, haunted by the sense of what we were missing, I felt an ache for “normal” as acute as any homesickness I ever felt — even when I served in the Army in Iraq. I still feel the twinge every time I put on my mask. I want our normal lives back.But what does normal even mean anymore?It’s easy to forget that 2020 gave us not just the pandemic, but also the West Coast’s worst fire season, as well as the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record. And, while we were otherwise distracted, 2020 also offered up near-record lows in Arctic sea ice, possible evidence of significant methane release from Arctic permafrost and the Arctic Ocean, huge wildfires in both the Amazon and the Arctic, shattered heat records (2020 rivaled 2016 for the hottest year on record), bleached coral reefs, the collapse of the last fully intact ice shelf in the Canadian Arctic, and increasing odds that the global climate system has passed the point where feedback dynamics take over and the window of possibility for preventing catastrophe closes.President Biden has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, which is great except that it doesn’t really mean much, since that agreement’s commitments are voluntary. And it might not even matter whether signatories meet their commitments, since their pledges weren’t rigorous enough to keep global warming “well below” two degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels to begin with. According to Climate Action Tracker, a collaborative analysis from independent science nonprofits, only Morocco and Gambia have made commitments compatible with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and the commitments made by several major emitters, including China, Russia, Japan and the United States, are “highly insufficient” or “critically insufficient.”It’s also worth noting that the two degrees Celsius benchmark is somewhat arbitrary and possibly fantastic, since it’s not clear that the earth’s climate would be safe or stable at that temperature. In the words of a widely discussed research summary published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, even if the Paris Agreement targets are met, “we cannot exclude the risk that a cascade of feedbacks could push the Earth System irreversibly onto a ‘Hothouse Earth’ pathway.”More alarming, recent observed increases in atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas more than 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over the short term, are so large that if they continue they could effectively overwhelm the pledged emissions reductions in the Paris Agreement, even if those reductions were actually happening. Which they’re not.Meanwhile, the earth’s climate seems to be changing faster than expected. Take the intensifying slowdown in the North Atlantic current, a global warming side effect made famous by the film “The Day After Tomorrow.” According to the climatologist Michael Mann, “We are 50 years to 100 years ahead of schedule with the slowdown of this ocean circulation pattern, relative to what the models predict … The more observations we get, the more sophisticated our models become, the more we’re learning that things can happen faster, and with a greater magnitude, than we predicted just years ago.”In 2019, the Greenland ice sheet briefly reached daily melt rates predicted in what were once considered worst-case scenarios for 2060 to 2080. Recent research indicates that rapidly thawing permafrost may release twice as much carbon dioxide and methane than previously thought, which is pretty bad news, because other recent research shows very cold Arctic permafrost thawing 70 years earlier than expected.Going back to normal now means returning to a course that will destabilize the conditions for all human life, everywhere on earth. Normal means more fires, more category 5 hurricanes, more flooding, more drought, millions upon millions more migrants fleeing famine and civil war, more crop failures, more storms, more extinctions, more record-breaking heat. Normal means the increasing likelihood of civil unrest and state collapse, of widespread agricultural failure and collapsing fisheries, of millions of people dying from thirst and hunger, of new diseases, old diseases spreading to new places and the havoc of war. Normal could well mean the end of global civilization as we know it.I remember last March, in the first throes of the pandemic, when normal was upended. Everything shut down. We hoarded toilet paper and pasta. Fear gripped the nation.I was afraid, too: I was afraid for my mother, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. I was afraid for my sister, whose husband works in a prison. I was afraid for my cousin, who’s a nurse. I was afraid for my country, under the leadership of an incompetent and seemingly deranged president.But along with the fear, I remembered a lesson I’d learned in Iraq. I’d been a soldier in Baghdad in 2003-2004, where I saw what happens when the texture of the everyday is ripped apart. I realized that what we call social life was like a vast and complex game, with imaginary rules we all agreed to follow, fictions we turned into fact through institutions, stories, and daily repetition. Some of the rules were old, deeply ingrained and resilient. Some were so tenuous they’d barely survive a hard wind.What I saw in Iraq was that every time you shock the system, something breaks. Sometimes those breaks never heal. There’s no way we can undo the damage we did to Iraq or bring back the lives lost to Covid. But sometimes those breaks are openings. Sometimes those breaks are opportunities to do things differently.In March last year, watching an unknown plague stalk the land, I felt fear, but I also felt hope: the hope that this virus, as horrible as it might be, could also give us the chance to really understand and internalize the fragility and transience of our collective existence. I hoped we might recognize not only that fossil-fuel-driven consumer capitalism was likely to destroy everything we loved, but that we might actually be able to do something about it.As the pandemic has worn on, the desire to get back to normal has increased, and I worry that the hope for radical positive change has subsided. But we must not let it dissipate. We can’t afford to. Because we won’t see “normal” again in our lifetimes. Our parents and grandparents burned normal up in their American-built cars, with their American lifestyles, their American refrigerators and American dreams. And now China and India are doing it, too, because capitalism is global, and we sold it wherever we could. More than three-quarters of all industrial CO2 emissions have occurred since 1945, and more than half have occurred since 1988 — since we knew what global warming was and what a danger it posed.Now, as a new administration takes office and we look ahead to life after both Covid and Donald Trump, we need to face the fact that the world we live in is changing into something else, and that coping with the consequences of global warming demands immediate, widespread, radical action.The next 20 years will be a period of deep uncertainty and tremendous risk, no matter what. We don’t get to choose what challenges we’ll face, but we do get to decide how we face them. The first thing we need to do is let go of the idea that life will ever be normal again — elsewhere, I’ve called this “learning how to die.” Beyond that, we need stop living through social media and start connecting with the people around us, since those are the people we’ll need to depend on the next time disaster strikes. And disaster will strike, you can be sure of that, so we must begin preparing today for the next shock to the social order, and the next, and the next.None of this will matter, though, if our preparations don’t include imagining a new way of life beyond this one, after the end of fossil-fueled capitalism: not a new normal, but a new ethos adapted to the chaotic world we’ve created.Roy Scranton is the author of several books, including “Learning to Die in the Anthropocene” and “We’re Doomed.

	<title>Think Americans Wouldn’t Wager on Russian Table Tennis? Care to Bet?</title>
	<author>Andrew Keh</author>
	<body>To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.They play the matches in quiet, sparsely decorated rooms in Moscow, in tournaments that run every day and at all hours, with a hodgepodge of athletes who vary drastically in age and, in many cases, actual athleticism.And every month millions of dollars are wagered on their every move.This is the Russian Liga Pro, an obscure, semiprofessional table tennis competition that has over the past 10 months become the unlikeliest of sports betting phenomena in the United States.“It’s crazy to think I’ve made hundreds of dollars watching old guys play Ping-Pong in Russia,” said Shayan Ahmad, 23, of North Brunswick, N.J., one of many new, eager table tennis gamblers.The improbable arrival of Russian table tennis on the betting scene was swift and opportune. It came in the early days of the pandemic, when dedicated gamblers were scavenging a denuded sports landscape for something, anything, to put a bit of money on.But bettors and bookmakers tend to find a way, and soon competitions like Belarusian ice hockey, Nicaraguan soccer and South Korean baseball were tabbed to fill the void. Later, as the big leagues cautiously returned to the scene, all of these sports returned to obscurity.All, that is, except Russian table tennis, which has remained one of the most popular draws in American sports books for nearly a year.“It’s fun, it’s random, and it feels like anything can happen,” said Isaiah Croft, 23, a furniture builder from Chesapeake, Va., who bets on the DraftKings website during frequent trips to Denver, where he grew up. “It’s Russian table tennis. It’s exhilarating.”That low-stakes games of table tennis contested between little-known players in rooms as quiet as tombs could be described as exhilarating speaks to the savvy of the competition’s organizers, of whom little is publicly known, and the league’s peculiar structure.The daily slate of matches is almost farcically crammed, a new contest starting every half-hour, churning from morning to night. Like reruns of “Law &amp; Order,” there always seems to be one on. For American gamblers accustomed to the slow buildup to N.F.L. weekends, the glut of betting opportunities is veritable catnip.The matches can be streamed on some betting platforms or third-party websites, but they are not much to look at. A single camera placed in an upper corner of a mostly barren room captures the action. There are no announcements, no commentary, none of the fanfare of pro sports.Some players are young, others are graying. Some are trim, others less so. The worst of them could still easily dispatch a casual player on a basement table, but the overall standard of play is firmly below the world’s professional leagues and international competitions.“It’s always like two old guys in gym shorts and T-shirts just playing in some empty room,” Ahmad said, “and there might be a girl with a scoreboard, the kind you used to see in gym class, where you flip the numbers over by hand.”Drab aesthetics aside, the Russian Liga Pro — which is also referred to as the Moscow Liga Pro or Russia Liga Pro, depending on the sports book — seems perfectly structured to satisfy the appetites of international gamblers, and the numbers indicate that it is doing a fine job of that.Jay Croucher, head of trading at PointsBet, an online sports book, said in an interview that table tennis represented more than 50 percent of the company’s total handle, or money accepted in wagers, last April after the professional sports world imploded under the weight of the pandemic. Even when major leagues around the world started to return over the summer, the game still commanded about a quarter of all betting on the site. Today, with most big sports running close to full steam, table tennis remains the fifth biggest draw on the platform, behind football, basketball, soccer and tennis.The trend has been even more pronounced in certain states. In Colorado, for instance, table tennis drew $12.4 million in wagers across all sports books in November, making it the third biggest sport for bettors there, behind only professional and college football.“There is an element of it which is baffling,” Croucher said. “It’s just not something you’d expect.”A representative for the league, responding to questions by email, said the organization had been active since 2017 and that its player pool was composed of more than a thousand “former professional athletes, semiprofessionals and amateurs.” He declined to reveal prize amounts, saying only they were “sufficient and serve as an additional motivation to demonstrate their best qualities in every match and prepare well for tournaments.”Regarding the odd hours of play — some matches are scheduled at 2, 3, 4 and 5 a.m., Moscow time — the representative explained that “many athletes wanted to play after work in the evening hours and at night.” Never mentioning gambling, he also said, “Our main goal is to develop table tennis in Russia.”The rise of table tennis in the gambling world has not been entirely smooth. Over the summer, authorities in New Jersey and Colorado suspended betting on similarly obscure table tennis competitions in Ukraine after agencies raised concerns about potential match fixing. Those matches had also become popular among American bettors.Last month, the police in New South Wales, Australia, whose state capital is Sydney, arrested a former member of the national table tennis team named Adam Green for his role in what was described as a “transnational gambling syndicate.” His corrupt bets on Ukrainian matches had resulted in winnings valued at 500,000 Australian dollars, or about $385,000, the police said.The Russian Liga Pro, though, has never been flagged for any suspicious activity, and it continues to draw in more and more curious gamblers.Ahmad, who works as a server at a Topgolf location, started betting on Russian table tennis at the start of the pandemic and has since established something of a comforting routine: Arriving home from work around midnight, he takes a shower, eases into bed and begins looking for enticing table tennis matches to bet on.He finds the activity funny on some level, but has surprised himself with the volume of information he has retained and his relative success. Some days, he said, his table tennis winnings exceed his earnings at his job.“People are like, ‘Yo, how do you know the names?’” he said. “I have all these Russian names in my head. I know who’s good.”Brad Humphreys, a sports economist at West Virginia University, said the rise of table tennis was a surprise — “If I would have made a list of sports that experienced increases in betting volume, international table tennis would not have been in the top 100” — but that it followed some basic gambling wisdom.The format, Humphreys said, is key. Points in the Liga Pro move quickly, and many table tennis gamblers, like Croft, focus entirely on fast-action midgame bets, wagering on which player will win the next point. Matches are brief, too, with winners often decided in less time than an N.F.L. halftime show. For gamblers, it is a quick rush, the equivalent of a scratch-off lottery ticket.“Anything you can do to get the rush you get from winning or losing a bet more quickly, people tend to do that,” Humphreys said, “which is why slot machines are so addictive.”Still, shrewd wagerers always believe they can find an edge.Nick Webster, an emergency dispatcher from Nashua, N.H., who works overnight shifts, began betting on table tennis as a way to battle boredom. He said he had stacks of notepads to track players and matchups and to inform his picks.He has a favorite player, a middle-aged competitor named Aleksey Lobanov, and sometimes watches Liga Pro matches on the internet for fun, even when he does not have a wager down.He paused to acknowledge the absurdity of this, of how deeply into this world he has burrowed.“All of a sudden I find myself rooting for Lobanov, a guy who I’d never heard of in my life, and now he’s like one of my favorite athletes,” he said. “It’s too bad I can’t go into a shop and get a Lobanov jersey.”Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow.</body>

	<title>Cook for Yourself</title>
	<author>Sam Sifton</author>
	<body>Good morning. I was flying solo there for a couple of days, cooking only for myself. This was not as simple as I’d thought it might be, as many over the years have pointed out to me in letters and messages, at cocktail parties, at the end of news meetings, once at a funeral. The business of cooking dinner, for me, for a lot of us, is inextricably linked to the idea of service, to the notion that by feeding others we are offering pleasure as a kind of gift, a sacrament. Left to our own devices, we might fall into traps: eggs all the time, toast, cookies. One night I found myself spooning peanut butter into my mouth over the sink.That’s not a good place to be, and particularly during this pandemic, when so many are spending so much time alone. I resolved to do better. At the market, I found a skirt steak about the length of an iPhone, and I grabbed a single potato. I bought a thatch of watercress. I wedged the potato into eighths and showered the slices with salt and neutral oil on a small sheet pan, then slid it into a hot oven to roast. I sprayed salt all over the steak and seared it in an oil-slicked cast-iron pan, flipped it a couple times, then took it off the heat and basted it in butter and thyme, with a single clove of garlic. I let it rest.The potatoes were golden and crisp by then, and I put them on a plate beside some watercress, sliced the steak and drizzled everything with a little of the basting butter. Ate that at the kitchen counter watching “Pretend It’s a City,” and it was a pretty good night.But the next morning? Eating the leftover steak with soft scrambled eggs and sautéed watercress while reading the newspaper and drinking a cup of tea? That was glorious stuff, self-care at its highest, and I was determined to tell you about it because all of us at some time are going to need a prompt to cook, for themselves and for others. I’m here to provide it. Cook. You’ll find in the meal, or the leftovers that follow, something approaching grace.Cook what? I’ve got loads of ideas. Take a look at this creamy cauliflower soup with rosemary olive oil (above), and at these crisped chickpeas in spicy brown butter. Consider this fish with sizzling olive butter and, in a riff on my solo meal, these steak mock frites.Make a salad. Make chili. Make soup.If you’re like me and dining alone, consider quartering this recipe for trout. You don’t need a fireplace in which to cook it, but if you have one, it’s an adventure for sure. Try this cauliflower chaat. Make a small chicken soup. Turn to the omelet. It won’t let you down.There are many thousands more recipes to make for yourself or others awaiting your attention on NYT Cooking. Go take a look and see what you find. Then save the recipes you like. And rate the recipes you’ve cooked. Leave a note on that recipe, if you’ve come up with a hack or ingredient substitution that you’d like to remember or alert to your fellow subscribers.I know I go on about that a lot, about how you need a subscription to enjoy the benefits of NYT Cooking. That’s because subscriptions support the work of dozens and allow it to continue. I hope, if you haven’t already, that you will subscribe to NYT Cooking today. Thank you.We will meanwhile be standing by at cookingcare@nytimes.com in case you get jammed up. Just drop us a line and someone will get back to you.Now, it’s nothing to do with those sharp Japanese mandolins or how often I think about buying a countertop pizza oven, but Jericho Brown wrote a poem for The Times to commemorate the inauguration last week of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President Kamala Harris, and I think you should read it. It’s called “Inaugural.”Here’s a fascinating tale in The Atlantic on efforts to save the corpse flower, of which very few are left in the wild.This is Novos Baianos, “A Menina Dança,” from 1972.Finally, you need a book? Hit the library for “Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,” by Paul Torday. Comedy, tragedy, satire — it’s all there. Enjoy, and I’ll be back on Wednesday.</body>

	<title>The Flaming Lips Performed to People in Literal Bubbles. Is It Safer?</title>
	<author>Johnny Diaz</author>
	<body>There are Covid-19 bubbles — small clusters of friends or family who agree to socialize exclusively with each other during the pandemic — and then there are the kinds of bubbles the Flaming Lips used at recent concerts.Band members and concertgoers rocked out and bounced while encased in large individual plastic bubbles amid bright swirling lights in trippy scenes at concerts on Friday and Saturday in Oklahoma City.The band has taken the elaborate precautions at its live performances to protect against the transmission of the coronavirus, but some health experts were unsure about the effectiveness of those measures.“I’d need to see how the air exchange was occurring between the outside and the inside of the bubbles to be able to say if it were safe over all or reduced risk of transmission,” said Dr. Eric Cioe-Peña, director of global health at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y.The Flaming Lips, a psych-rock band founded in the early 1980s and known for their exuberant live shows and recording experiments, had a similar concert in October, and also had performed their song “Race for the Prize” in June using the spheres on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”The concerts held on Friday and Saturday were originally scheduled for December, but the band postponed them because of rising Covid-19 cases in the Oklahoma City metro area.“It’s a very restricted, weird event,” the band’s frontman, Wayne Coyne, told Rolling Stone last month. “But the weirdness is so we can enjoy a concert before putting our families and everybody at risk.”“I think it’s a bit of a new normal,” he added. “You might go to a show, you might not, but I think we’re going to be able to work it out.”In March, Mr. Coyne posted a sketch on Instagram showing what the bubble concert might look like.Nathan Poppe, a videographer and photographer documenting the show for the band, said on Twitter that the floor was set up in a grid of 10 bubbles by 10 bubbles. “Each bubble may contain one person or two or maybe three,” he said.Photos showed fans climbing inside the spheres on the concert floor, where the bubbles were then inflated with leaf blowers.Each bubble came equipped with a high-frequency speaker, water bottle, fan, towel and a sign if someone had to use the restroom or if it was too hot inside. If it got too stuffy inside, the bubble could be refilled with cool air, Mr. Poppe said.He said concertgoers could take their masks off inside the bubble but had to wear them after leaving the bubble.“You roll your bubble to the exit and unzip it at the door,” he said.It was not immediately clear what became of the used bubbles after the 90-minute performances, which were attended by about 200 people each.Some health experts had concerns about users’ safety inside the bubbles.“There is no evidence about the efficacy — or lack thereof — of these bubbles from an infectious disease transmission point of view,” said Dr. Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health.He said that virus transmission control depends on good air circulation and filtration.“So, in theory, if air filtration is good, protective barriers can helpfully augment and reduce risk of transmission, but I would be hesitant to attend a concert in a bubble at the moment unless this has been assessed further,” he said.Dr. Cioe-Peña said the plastic bubbles used at the concerts seemed to be unventilated. But if each of the bubbles “had a bidirectionally filtered air supply,” he said, “this would effectively prevent Covid transmission between bubbles.”While a plastic bubble could help reduce exposure to “infectious agents” if it is filled with filtered air, it could also lead to raised carbon dioxide levels inside the bubble, said Richard E. Peltier, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.“My recommendation would be to add a small CO2 sensor to the bubble,” he said. “Though they aren’t always the most precise, they should be sufficient to tell a concertgoer that it is time for a break and refresh that stale air. And then get back to enjoying the music safely.”At least 48 new Covid-19 deaths and 2,941 new cases were reported in Oklahoma on Sunday, according to a New York Times database.</body>

	<title>Twitter bloqueó a Trump: así se tomó la decisión</title>
	<author>Mike Isaac</author>
	<body>SAN FRANCISCO — Jack Dorsey, el director ejecutivo de Twitter, estaba trabajando a distancia en una isla privada en la Polinesia Francesa frecuentada por celebridades que intentan escapar de los paparazzi cuando una llamada telefónica lo interrumpió. Era el 6 de enero.Del otro lado de la línea estaba Vijaya Gadde, la abogada principal y experta en seguridad de Twitter, con una noticia del mundo real. Le dijo que ella y otros ejecutivos de la empresa habían decidido bloquear la cuenta del presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, de manera temporal, a fin de impedir que publicara declaraciones que provocaran más violencia después de que una turba asaltó el Capitolio de Estados Unidos ese día.A Dorsey le preocupó la decisión, según dijeron dos personas enteradas de la llamada. Durante cuatro años, el ejecutivo se había resistido ante las solicitudes de liberales y otras personas de cancelar la cuenta de Trump, con el argumento de que la plataforma era un lugar en el que los líderes mundiales podían expresarse, aunque sus posturas fueran atroces. Sin embargo, le había delegado las decisiones de moderación a Gadde, de 46 años, y solía deferir al criterio de ella y, en este caso, lo hizo de nuevo.Dorsey, de 44 años, no externó sus dudas en público. Al día siguiente, compartió y le dio me gusta a varios tuits que instaban a la cautela con respecto a un bloqueo permanente de la cuenta de Trump. Después, en el transcurso de las siguientes 36 horas, Twitter pasó de levantar la suspensión de Trump a cerrar su cuenta de manera permanente, con lo que desconectó al presidente de una plataforma que había usado para comunicarse, sin filtro, no solo con sus 88 millones de seguidores, sino con el mundo entero.La decisión fue un signo de puntuación en la presidencia de Trump que de inmediato atrajo acusaciones de sesgo político y un escrutinio renovado en contra del poder que la industria tecnológica ostenta sobre el discurso público. Entrevistas llevadas a cabo a lo largo de la semana pasada con una docena de informantes que trabajan o trabajaron en Twitter ofrecen claridad respecto al modo en que se tomó esta decisión: un grupo de ejecutivos de confianza de Dorsey impulsaron la medida y vencieron las reservas de su jefe, pero solo después de que se desató una conducta violenta y mortal en el Capitolio.Tras levantar la suspensión al día siguiente, Twitter monitoreó las reacciones a los tuits de Trump en todo el internet y los ejecutivos le informaron a Dorsey que los seguidores de Trump habían aprovechado sus últimos mensajes para atizar más violencia. En una publicación en la red social alternativa Parler, miembros del equipo de seguridad de Twitter vieron que un fanático de Trump instó a grupos paramilitares a impedirle al presidente electo Joe Biden entrar a la Casa Blanca y a que combatieran a cualquiera que intentara detenerlos. El potencial de que hubiera disturbios mucho mayores con consecuencias reales era demasiado alto.Twitter también enfrentaba la presión de sus empleados, quienes habían hecho llamados durante años para eliminar a Trump del sitio, así como de legisladores, inversionistas de tecnología y otros. No obstante, aunque más de 300 empleados firmaron una carta que afirmaba que la cuenta de Trump debía cerrarse, la decisión de expulsar al presidente de la plataforma se tomó antes de que la carta fuera entregada a los ejecutivos, según afirmaron dos de las personas involucradas.El miércoles, Dorsey aludió a las tensiones dentro de Twitter. En un hilo de 13 tuits, escribió que no celebraba ni se sentía orgulloso de “tener que inhabilitar la cuenta de @realDonaldTrump” porque “es un fracaso en nuestra misión de promover un diálogo saludable”.Sin embargo, Dorsey agregó: “Esta fue la decisión correcta para Twitter. Nos enfrentamos a una circunstancia extraordinaria e insostenible que nos obligó a enfocar todas nuestras acciones en la seguridad pública”.Dorsey, Gadde y la Casa Blanca no respondieron a solicitudes de comentarios.Desde que se cerró la cuenta de Trump, muchas de las preocupaciones que Dorsey tenía sobre la decisión se han vuelto realidad. Twitter se ha enredado en un debate furioso sobre el poder de las empresas tecnológicas y su falta de responsabilidad.Legisladores como el representante Devin Nunes, republicano por California, han arremetido contra Twitter, mientras que los capitalistas de riesgo de Silicon Valley, los académicos que estudian la Primera Enmienda y la Unión Estadounidense por las Libertades Civiles también han criticado a la empresa. Al mismo tiempo, activistas de todo el mundo han acusado a Twitter de utilizar un doble rasero al cortarle el paso a Trump, pero no a los autócratas de otros lugares que utilizan la plataforma para intimidar a sus oponentes.“Es un ejercicio fenomenal, poder sacar de una plataforma al presidente de Estados Unidos”, dijo Evelyn Douek, profesora de la Escuela de Derecho de Harvard que estudia el discurso en línea. “Debería provocar una reflexión más amplia”.Trump, quien se unió a Twitter en 2009, fue una fortuna y una maldición para la empresa. Sus tuits le valieron atención a Twitter, que a veces batalló para atraer a nuevos usuarios. Pero sus aseveraciones falsas y amenazas en línea también provocaron que sus críticos dijeran que el sitio le permitía propagar mentiras y propiciar asedio.Muchos de los más de 5400 empleados de Twitter se opusieron a que Trump en la plataforma. En agosto de 2019, poco después de que un pistolero matara a más de 20 personas en un Walmart en El Paso, Twitter convocó una reunión de personal para discutir cómo el pistolero, en un manifiesto en línea, se había hecho eco de muchos de los puntos de vista que Trump publicó en Twitter.En la reunión, llamada “Flock Talk”, algunos empleados dijeron que Twitter fue “cómplice” al darle a Trump un altavoz para mandar mensajes que sonaban normales pero que para sus seguidores tenían un doble sentido, dijeron dos asistentes. Los empleados imploraron a los ejecutivos que hicieran cambios antes de que más gente saliera herida.Con el tiempo, Twitter se volvió más proactivo en el manejo de contenido político. En octubre de 2019, Dorsey eliminó toda la publicidad política del sitio, pues dijo que le preocupaba que estos anuncios tuvieran “ramificaciones significativas que la estructura democrática de la actualidad quizá no está preparada para enfrentar”.En un tuit explicando la decisión, Dorsey dijo: “creemos que el alcance de los mensajes políticos debe ganarse, no comprarse”.Sin embargo, Dorsey, proponente de la libre expresión, se rehusó a eliminar las publicaciones de líderes mundiales porque las consideraba de interés informativo. Después de que Twitter anunció ese año que sería más flexible con los líderes mundiales que rompieran sus reglas, la empresa solo había eliminado sus tuits una vez: en marzo del año pasado, borró mensajes de los presidentes de Brasil y Venezuela que promovían curas falsas para el coronavirus. Dorsey se opuso a la eliminación de esos tuits, según dijo una persona enterada de su razonamiento.Dorsey abogó por una solución intermedia: añadir etiquetas a los tuits de líderes mundiales que violaran las políticas de Twitter. En mayo, cuando Trump tuiteó información errónea sobre la votación por correo, Dorsey dio la autorización para que Twitter empezara a etiquetar los mensajes del presidente.Tras las elecciones del 3 de noviembre, Trump anunció en un tuit que le habían robado la victoria. Al cabo de unos cuantos días, Twitter había etiquetado alrededor del 34 por ciento de sus tuits y retuits, según un conteo de The New York Times.Luego vino el asalto al Capitolio.El 6 de enero, cuando los miembros del Congreso se reunían para certificar el resultado de las elecciones, los ejecutivos de Twitter celebraban su adquisición de Ueno, una firma de diseño y posicionamiento de marca. Dorsey, quien a menudo se va a retiros, había viajado a la isla del Pacífico Sur, según dijeron las personas con información sobre su ubicación.Cuando Trump recurrió a Twitter para despotricar en contra del vicepresidente Mike Pence y cuestionar el resultado de las elecciones, la empresa añadió advertencias a sus tuits. Después, mientras se desataba la violencia en el Capitolio, la gente instó a Twitter y a Facebook a que bloquearan a Trump por completo.Eso causó debates virtuales entre algunos de los ejecutivos de confianza de Dorsey. El grupo incluía a Gadde, una abogada que se unió a Twitter en 2011; Del Harvey, vicepresidenta de Confianza y Seguridad, y Yoel Roth, director de Integridad del sitio. Harvey y Roth habían ayudado a desarrollar las respuestas de la empresa a los mensajes basura, el acoso y la interferencia en elecciones.Los ejecutivos decidieron suspender la cuenta de Trump ya que sus comentarios parecieron incitar a la turba, según dijeron las personas con conocimiento de las conversaciones. Entonces Gadde llamó a Dorsey, a quien no le agradó la decisión, según relataron.La cuenta de Trump no se inhabilitó por completo. Si eliminaba varios de los tuits que habían incitado a la turba, habría un periodo de espera de 12 horas. Luego podría volver a hacer publicaciones.Después de que Twitter bloqueó la cuenta de Trump, Facebook hizo lo mismo. Snapchat, Twitch y otros sitios también impusieron límites a Trump.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.No obstante, Dorsey no estaba convencido de prohibirle el acceso a Trump de manera permanente. Envió un correo electrónico a los empleados al día siguiente en el que expresaba que era importante que la empresa fuera congruente con sus políticas, incluso la de permitir que un usuario regrese a la plataforma tras una suspensión.Muchos trabajadores no estuvieron de acuerdo, por miedo a pasar la historia con una imagen poco favorecedora. Varios de ellos hicieron referencia a la colaboración de IBM con los nazis, según dijeron empleados actuales y antiguos de Twitter, y comenzaron una petición para eliminar la cuenta de Trump de inmediato.Ese mismo día, Facebook bloqueó el acceso de Trump al sitio al menos hasta el fin de su mandato. Pero el mandatario regresó a Twitter esa noche con un video que expresaba que habría una transición pacífica del poder.No obstante, a la mañana siguiente, Trump volvió a las andadas. Publicó un tuit que decía que sus bases tendrían una “VOZ GIGANTE” y que no asistiría a la ceremonia de investidura presidencial el 20 de enero.El equipo de seguridad de Twitter de inmediato vio que los fanáticos de Trump, quienes habían declarado que el presidente los había abandonado, publicaron intenciones de realizar más disturbios, según dijeron las personas enteradas del asunto. En un mensaje de Parler que revisó el equipo de seguridad, un usuario dijo que cualquiera que se opusiera a los “patriotas estadounidenses” como él debía irse de Washington o arriesgarse a sufrir lesiones físicas durante la ceremonia de investidura presidencial.El equipo de seguridad empezó a redactar un análisis de los tuits para valorar si justificaban la inhabilitación de la cuenta de Trump, dijeron los informantes.Ese día, alrededor del mediodía en San Francisco, Dorsey convocó una reunión de empleados. Algunos lo presionaron para que explicara por qué no había cerrado la cuenta de Trump de manera permanente.Dorsey repitió que Twitter debía ser congruente con sus políticas. Pero afirmó que había trazado una línea que el presidente no podía cruzar, de lo contario perdería los privilegios de su cuenta, según relataron las personas con información del evento.Después de la reunión, Dorsey y otros ejecutivos coincidieron en que los tuits que Trump había publicado esa mañana —y las respuestas que habían provocado— habían cruzado esa línea, según las personas informadas. La carta de los empleados que solicitaba la eliminación de la cuenta de Trump se entregó más tarde, afirmaron.En cuestión de horas, la cuenta personal de Trump había desaparecido, solo se veía una etiqueta de “cuenta suspendida”. Intentó publicar desde la cuenta @POTUS, que es la cuenta oficial del presidente de Estados Unidos, y desde otras. Pero en cada ocasión, Twitter frustró sus intentos al eliminar los mensajes.Algunos empleados de Twitter, temiendo la ira de los partidarios de Trump, ahora han configurado sus cuentas de Twitter en privado y han eliminado las menciones a su empleador de sus biografías en línea, dijeron cuatro personas. A varios ejecutivos se les asignó seguridad personal.Twitter también ha ampliado su ofensiva contra las cuentas que promueven la violencia. Durante el fin de semana, eliminó más de 70.000 cuentas que impulsaban la teoría de la conspiración de QAnon, que postula que Trump lucha contra una camarilla de pedófilos adoradores de Satanás.El miércoles, los empleados se reunieron virtualmente para discutir la decisión de vetar a Trump, dijeron dos asistentes. Algunos estaban agradecidos de que Twitter hubiera tomado medidas, mientras que otros estaban ansiosos por dejar atrás la era Trump. Muchos estaban emocionados; algunos lloraban.Esa tarde, Trump volvió de nuevo a Twitter, esta vez desde la cuenta oficial de @WhiteHouse para compartir un video en el que decía que condenaba la violencia, pero también denunciaba lo que él llamaba restricciones a la libertad de expresión. Twitter permitió que el video permaneciera en línea.Una hora más tarde, Dorsey tuiteó sobre su incomodidad con la eliminación de las cuentas de Trump. “Sienta un precedente que considero peligroso: el poder que un individuo o una corporación tiene sobre una parte de la conversación pública mundial”, escribió.Pero concluyó: “Todo lo que aprendamos en este momento mejorará nuestro esfuerzo, y nos empujará a ser lo que somos: una humanidad que trabaja junta”.Kate Conger es reportera de tecnología en San Francisco.

	<title>Biden overturns Trump’s transgender military ban.</title>
	<author>Michael D. Shear</author>
	<body>President Biden reversed his predecessor’s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, administration officials announced Monday, moving swiftly into a social issue that has tangled the Pentagon over the past five years.With Lloyd J. Austin III, his new defense secretary, by his side in the Oval Office, Mr. Biden signed an executive order restoring protections first put in place by former President Barack Obama that opened up the ranks of the armed services to qualified transgender people. “What I’m doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform,” Mr. Biden said from behind the Resolute Desk moments before putting his signature on the document.The move was expected, as Mr. Biden indicated in November that he would work to restore the protections, which were reversed by former President Donald J. Trump.But the swiftness signaled a willingness by the new Biden administration to put its own stamp on Defense Department social issues. It follows an announcement from Mr. Austin on Saturday that he was ordering up a review of how the Pentagon has been handling sexual assault issues.Mr. Biden and the Defense Department leadership will also have to wrestle with a reckoning on race that is facing the Pentagon, where officials have had to confront a stark fact: close to one in five of the protesters who have been arrested for breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6 — many of them with links to white supremacist organizations — have ties to the American military.On the transgender issue, advocacy groups that have been fighting the ban since it was announced three years ago — in a tweet from Mr. Trump — have argued that the Pentagon does not need to spend months studying how to allow transgender people to serve because it had already done so. One such group, the Palm Center, said in a policy memo last summer that the military could reopen to transgender people rapidly if ordered to do so.“A big ship can take time to turn around, so often the Pentagon needs to study policy changes and move cautiously,” Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, said last July in an interview. “But this is the rare case where, since the military left inclusive policy for already-serving transgender personnel in place even as it implemented its ban, the switch is just waiting to be flipped.”The Trump ban had essentially ended an Obama administration initiative to allow transgender troops to serve openly in the military.</body>

	<body>AMARO is a bittersweet Italian liqueur, which is strongly flavored with botanicals.The word AMARO means “bitter” in Italian. It is typically made by macerating a mix of herbs, spices, barks, roots and flowers in either a neutral spirit, or a wine. As such, the range of flavors offered by different amari is vast. Some are very sweet, made with citrus peels or honey. Others are medicinal, made with alpine herbs.AMARO has appeared five times in the New York Times Crossword, most recently in the Thursday, Jan. 21 puzzle by Daniel Mauer.“Italian herbal liqueur,” “Bitter, in Bologna”Join us here to solve Crosswords, The Mini, and other games by The New York Times</body>

	<title>As Trump Seeks to Remain a Political Force, New Targets Emerge</title>
	<author>Reid J. Epstein</author>
	<body>Former President Donald J. Trump, determined to remain a force in G.O.P. politics, is gaining new opportunities with a crucial Senate seat unexpectedly coming open in Ohio, an ally announcing for governor of Arkansas and rising pressure on Republicans in Congress who did not stand with him during this month’s impeachment vote.The surprise announcement on Monday by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio that he would not seek a third term sparked a political land rush, with top strategists in the state receiving a flood of phone calls from potential candidates testing their viability. One consultant said he had received calls from five would-be candidates by midday.That opening, along with another statewide contest next year in which Gov. Mike DeWine is expected to face at least one Trump-aligned primary challenger, is likely to make Ohio a central battleground for control of the Republican Party, and an inviting one for Mr. Trump, who held on to Ohio in the election while losing three other Northern battleground states.Mr. Portman’s announcement came hours after Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s former White House press secretary, began her campaign for Arkansas governor. The Republican primary there already includes the state’s lieutenant governor and attorney general, but private polling indicates that Ms. Sanders is beginning well ahead, and Mr. Trump endorsed her candidacy on Monday night. Mr. Trump has only been out of the presidential office five days and has little in the way of political infrastructure. He has told aides he would like to take a break for several months. But the former president has remained the party’s strongest fund-raiser, with tens of millions in PAC money at his disposal, and he retains an enduring base of Republican support across the country. Perhaps most important, he harbors a deep-seated desire to punish those he believes have crossed him and reward those who remain loyal.So far he has focused primarily on Georgia, where he believes the Republican governor and secretary of state betrayed him by certifying his loss there. Both are up for re-election in 2022. And he took something of a test run over the weekend by getting involved in the leadership fight in Arizona’s Republican Party, after Kelli Ward, the firebrand chairwoman, asked for his help in gaining re-election, according to a person familiar with the discussions.Already there is a movement at the state and local levels to challenge incumbent members of Congress seen as breaking with the former president, starting with the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach him this month.The overwhelming consensus among Ohio Republicans is that a Trump-aligned candidate would be best positioned to win a competitive Senate primary, and no potential candidate has a better claim to Mr. Trump’s voters in the state than Representative Jim Jordan, who was Mr. Trump’s chief defender during his first impeachment trial and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom during the former president’s final days in office.“Jim is well positioned if in fact he’s ready to take that leap; I’m not sure there’s anybody that would beat him,” said Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio secretary of state and longtime Portman ally who last month served as an Electoral College voter for Mr. Trump. Referring to Mr. Trump’s legion of supporters, Mr. Blackwell added: “In Ohio, it’s going to be who has the track record to show that their agenda respects the newly realigned party base.”Mr. Trump is now ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where aides are building something that can serve as an office. He’s been golfing several times, and was spotted by people at his club in Florida playing with the brother of the former tennis star Anna Kournikova on Sunday.His advisers have had discussions about whether to get him back on some form of social media platform, although they insist that he does not need to be on Twitter or Facebook to raise money, and that his email solicitations continue to work well. On Monday he formally opened the Office of the Former President, to manage his “correspondence, public statements, appearances, and official activities.”As President Biden’s inauguration approached, Mr. Trump began telling some allies that he was considering forming a third party if Republicans moved to convict him in the Senate trial. But by Saturday, after his own advisers said it was a mistake, Mr. Trump started sending out word that he was moving on from his threat.“He understands that the best thing for his movement and conservatism is to move forward together, that third parties will lead to dominance by Democrats,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who is a close ally of Mr. Trump.Advisers to the president say he has just over $70 million in his PAC, Save America, with few restrictions on what he can do with it. For now, most of his staff is on a government payroll afforded to former presidents for a period of time after they leave office.Officials are working to mend Mr. Trump’s relationship with Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the House minority leader, whom Mr. Trump called a vulgarity for his House floor speech denouncing the former president’s rally address before the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. A senior Republican said that aides to the two men were trying to arrange a meeting or a call in the coming days. And Mr. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., spoke with Mr. McCarthy recently and the two are on good terms, a person briefed on the call said. Mr. Trump would like to seek retribution against House members who voted against him, and he has been particularly angry with Representatives Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio and Fred Upton of Michigan, advisers said. He will also at some point focus on the governor’s race in Arizona, where Doug Ducey cannot seek re-election; Gov. Greg Abbott’s re-election bid in Texas; and the Senate race in North Carolina, as places where he can show strength, the advisers said. (One adviser disputed that Mr. Trump would have an interest in the Texas race.)In Ohio, Mr. Gonzalez faces a potential primary challenge from Christina Hagan, a former state legislator whom he defeated in a 2018 primary. Ms. Hagan lost in the general election last year to Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat, in a neighboring district. She said in an interview Monday that she would decide which, if any, race to enter in 2022 after Ohio redraws its congressional districts; the state is likely to lose one seat and Republicans control all levers of redistricting.“A lot of people elected what they thought was conservative leadership and now are witnessing somebody cutting against their values,” Ms. Hagan said, alluding to Mr. Gonzalez’s vote to impeach. Mr. Gonzalez’s office did not respond to emails seeking comment.Mr. Trump’s deepest hostility is reserved for Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, advisers said, and they expect he will expend the most energy trying to damage Mr. Kemp’s re-election bid. The governor’s original sin was in choosing Kelly Loeffler over Mr. Trump’s favored candidate, Doug Collins, to fill a vacant Senate seat in 2019, but it evolved into something more consuming as Mr. Trump repeated his debunked claims of widespread fraud in the state and held Mr. Kemp responsible for not doing enough to challenge the election results.Mr. Collins, a hard-line Trump backer, hasn’t decided whether to challenge Mr. Kemp or seek the Republican nomination against Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democrat who defeated Ms. Loeffler in a special election and will face voters again in 2022, or if he will choose not to run for anything, a Collins aide said Monday.Next on Mr. Trump’s personal hit list is Representative Liz Cheney, the Republican from Wyoming, people close to him said. Ms. Cheney was the only member of the House G.O.P. leadership to vote to impeach. It’s unclear whether Mr. Trump will target her seat, or simply her leadership post in the House, but advisers said they anticipated that he would take opportunities to damage her.Sarah Longwell, the executive director of the Republican Accountability Project, an anti-Trump group, said she and her colleagues planned to raise and spend $50 million to defend the 10 pro-impeachment House Republicans in primary contests and attack those who voted to object to the Electoral College results after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. She said the group would aim to defeat Mr. Jordan in an Ohio Senate primary if he runs against an establishment-minded Republican.Mr. Jordan’s spokesman did not respond to messages on Monday.The 2022 map will be the first real test of Mr. Trump’s durability in the party. While Ms. Sanders is running for governor in Arkansas, rumors that his daughter Ivanka would run for Senate in Florida are unlikely to develop further. And though his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, was said to be considering a Senate run in North Carolina, people close to the family say it is less clear what she will do now that Mr. Trump lost.Mr. Trump’s advisers are more focused on the looming impeachment trial. He is working closely with Mr. Graham, who has argued to his colleagues that Mr. Trump’s Senate trial sets a bad precedent.Mr. Graham helped him retain a South Carolina-based lawyer, Butch Bowers, who is also working to fill out a legal team with colleagues from the state, Mr. Graham and others said. Mr. Bowers is expected to work with a Trump adviser, Jason Miller, on some kind of response operation.Unlike his first impeachment trial, when the Republican National Committee engaged in a constant defense of the president, including paying for his lawyers, this time it is expected to focus only on rapid response, including calling the Senate trial unconstitutional and a procedural overreach, two people familiar with the committee’s plans said.</body>

	<title>Senator Patrick Leahy, the longest-serving Democrat, will preside over Trump’s impeachment trial.</title>
	<author>Nicholas Fandos</author>
	<body>Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Senate president pro tempore, is expected to preside over former President Donald J. Trump’s impeachment trial when it formally begins on Tuesday, assuming a role filled last year by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., aides and other officials said on Monday.The Constitution states that the chief justice of the United States presides over any impeachment trial of the president or vice president. But it does not explicitly give guidance on who should oversee the proceeding for others, including former presidents, and it appeared that Chief Justice Roberts was uninterested in reprising a time consuming role that would insert him and the Supreme Court directly into the fractious political fight over Mr. Trump.Mr. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, recently reclaimed the mantle of president pro tempore — the position reserved for the longest-serving member of the majority party — when Democrats took control of the Senate. Mr. Leahy, 80, has been in office since 1974. The role was largely ceremonial in the first impeachment trial of Mr. Trump a year ago. But as the presiding officer, Mr. Leahy could issue rulings on key questions around the admissibility of evidence and whether a trial of a former president is even allowed under the Constitution. (Mr. Leahy is also still expected to have a vote in the trial, like other senators.)The job could also have gone to Vice President Kamala Harris, in her capacity as president of the Senate. But there were clear drawbacks for Ms. Harris in overseeing what is likely to be a divisive proceeding that is all but certain to be regarded by some as an effort by Democrats to use their newfound power to punish the leader of the rival political party. Mr. Leahy’s presence on the dais could open Democrats to similar charges from the right, particularly if he issues a contentious ruling, but officials said there was no clear alternative without the chief justice. In a statement, Mr. Leahy said he would take “extraordinarily seriously” his trial oath to administer “impartial justice.”“When I preside over the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, I will not waver from my constitutional and sworn obligations to administer the trial with fairness, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws,” he said.Senate aides suggested Ms. Harris may still be able to intervene to break a tie if the trial ever deadlocked 50-50, as she can in the Senate’s normal course of business. It would take two-thirds of the Senate, 67 votes, to convict Mr. Trump, but if he were convicted, only a simple majority would be needed to bar him from holding office again. The chief justice declined through a spokeswoman to comment.</body>

	<title>Israel Extradites Teacher Accused of Abuse in Australia, Reports Say</title>
	<author>Livia Albeck-Ripka</author>
	<body>JERUSALEM — An Israeli woman accused of sexually abusing students at an Australian school where she was the principal has been extradited from Israel, according to reports in the Israeli news media, concluding a seven-year deportation process that had tested relations between the two countries.Malka Leifer, 54, is accused of 74 counts of rape and sexual abuse that investigators say took place between 2004 and 2008, when she was the principal of a Jewish girls’ school in Melbourne.Australian officials formally sought her extradition in 2014, but the process was repeatedly delayed after Ms. Leifer’s legal team at the time argued that she was mentally unfit to stand trial.Photographs published Monday on an Israeli news website, Ynet, showed Ms. Leifer being escorted aboard a plane in Tel Aviv on Sunday night.Ms. Leifer’s lawyer, Nick Kaufman, said he had not received official confirmation that she had been deported but had been told she would be sent to Australia this week. Officials at the Israeli foreign and justice ministries, state attorney’s office, police force and prison service declined to comment, as did the Australian attorney-general’s office.Ms. Leifer, an Israeli citizen, moved in 2001 to Australia, where she later became the principal of Adass Israel, a school for ultra-Orthodox Jewish girls, and then fled to Israel in 2008 after details of the assault allegations emerged.The sluggish pace of the deportation process drew occasional criticism from Australian lawmakers. The case also embroiled an ultra-Orthodox Israeli government minister from the same sect as Ms. Leifer, Yaakov Litzman, after the Israeli police accused him of pressuring psychiatrists to report that Ms. Leifer was not well enough to be tried.The case centers on the allegations of three sisters — Dassi Erlich, Elly Sapper and Nicole Meyer — who say they were abused by Ms. Leifer during her tenure as school principal.Ms. Meyer declined to comment on Monday about Ms. Leifer’s extradition. But victim’s rights groups and those close to the three sisters who have publicly spoken about their abuse said that they were overjoyed by the news that Ms. Leifer was on her way to Australia.“They didn’t believe this day would come,” said Manny Waks, an abuse survivor and the chief executive of VoiCSA, a group that combats child sexual abuse in the Jewish community.“I know that they are absolutely elated at the news and they are looking forward to their day in court and to holding Leifer to full account,” Mr. Waks said.The trial of Ms. Leifer is unlikely to take place in 2021 because of logistical challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Mr. Kaufman.After arriving in Australia, she is expected to appear by video link before a judge who will formally confirm her identity and read her the charges, Mr. Kaufman said.“We hope that she will be held in a place of detention that will respect her religious beliefs and allow her contact with her lawyers and family on a regular basis,” Mr. Kaufman said.Mr. Kaufman also said that the publication of photographs of Ms. Leifer’s extradition had undermined her dignity.The Australian attorney general’s office said in a statement that the government was aware of the reports about Ms. Leifer’s extradition but could not comment on the process until she had formally concluded the extradition process.“Both the attorney-general and minister for foreign affairs have expressed their thanks to the Israel government for its assistance and cooperation to bring this long-running process to a conclusion,” the statement added.Officials at the German police force and Frankfurt airport, where Ms. Leifer was reported to have transferred onto a flight to Australia, said they could not confirm that she was in transit.Patrick Kingsley reported from Jerusalem and Livia Albeck-Ripka from Melbourne. Myra Noveck contributed reporting from Jerusalem.</body>

	<title>Grindr is fined $11.7 million under European privacy law.</title>
	<author>Aaron Krolik</author>
	<body>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority said on Monday that it would fine Grindr, the world’s most popular gay dating app, 100 million Norwegian kroner, or about $11.7 million, for illegally disclosing private details about its users to advertising companies.The agency said the app had transmitted users’ precise locations, user-tracking codes and the app’s name to at least five advertising companies, essentially tagging individuals as L.G.B.T.Q. without obtaining their explicit consent, in violation of European data protection law. Grindr shared users’ private details with, among other companies, MoPub, Twitter’s mobile advertising platform, which may in turn share data with more than 100 partners, according to the agency’s ruling.Tobias Judin, head of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s international department, said Grindr’s data-mining practices not only violated European privacy rights but also could have put users at serious risk in countries, like Qatar and Pakistan, where consensual same-sex sexual acts are illegal.“If someone finds out that they are gay and knows their movements, they may be harmed,” Mr. Judin said. “We’re trying to make these apps and services understand that this approach — not informing users, not gaining a valid consent to share their data — is completely unacceptable.”The fine comes one year after European nonprofit groups lodged complaints against Grindr and its advertising partners with data protection regulators. In tests last January, The New York Times found that the Android version of the Grindr app was sharing location information that was so precise, it pinpointed reporters on the side of the building they were sitting on. In April, Grindr revamped its user consent process.In a statement, a spokesperson for Grindr said the company had obtained “valid legal consent from all” of its users in Europe on multiple occasions and was confident that its “approach to user privacy is first in class” among social apps.The statement added: “We continually enhance our privacy practices in consideration of evolving privacy laws and regulations, and look forward to entering into a productive dialogue with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.”The company has until Feb. 15 to comment on the ruling before it is final. The Norwegian agency said it was investigating whether the ad companies that received users’ details from Grindr had also violated European data protection law.”Privacy experts said the ruling would have wide repercussions beyond dating apps.“This not only sets limits for Grindr,” said Finn Myrstad, the director of digital policy for the Norwegian Consumer Council, one of the groups that lodged the complaints, “but establishes strict legal requirements on a whole industry that profits from collecting and sharing information about our preferences, location, purchases, physical and mental health, sexual orientation and political views.”</body>

	<title>As Angry Farmers Take to New Delhi’s Streets, Protests Turn Violent</title>
	<author>Hari Kumar</author>
	<body>NEW DELHI — Thousands of protesting farmers poured into New Delhi on Tuesday, using their tractors to pull apart barricades and challenging government forces who fired tear gas, blocked internet access and charged demonstrators with bamboo sticks to bring some order to a capital that felt under siege.It was the most violent escalation in two months of generally peaceful protests that have tested the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in unprecedented ways, forcing it to offer concessions to aggrieved farmers on new market-friendly laws that were intended to overhaul the country’s agriculture sector. But the farmers have insisted on nothing short of repealing the laws that were pushed through Parliament in September, leaving them, they say, vulnerable to corporate greed.The deadlock boiled over in what — for Mr. Modi at least — was an embarrassing showdown that came on a national holiday and in the midst of a pandemic and economic slowdown that have also challenged his leadership.As Mr. Modi, in a red turban, saluted his officers and watched his country’s latest warplanes fly over a grand parade marking 72 years since India’s inception as a republic, protesters riding atop tens of thousands of tractors were dismantling barricades and rumbling toward the city center.By late evening, at least one person had died and many parts of the city seemed unnerved.  Farm leaders, who had promised their march would be peaceful but had clearly lost control, distanced themselves from the violence and appealed to the protesters to return to the campsites they have occupied for the past two months at the capital’s borders.The Delhi police said 86 members of its force were wounded.“Farmer agitators broke the agreed terms and started their march much before the agreed time,” the Delhi police said in a statement. “The agitators chose the path of violence and destruction.”Several rounds of talks between the farmers and the government over the new laws failed to bring a resolution. By choosing to carry out the tractor march on a day that eyes would be fixed on New Delhi for the parade (guests in previous years included the presidents of the United States, Russia and France), the farmers were aiming for a show of force.But by the end of Tuesday, attention was focused on the chaos and clashes, and it was unclear whether the farmers had flexed their muscles or weakened their position. Until now, their cause had drawn wide popular support for how disciplined the tens of thousands of farmers had remained during two months camping out in the cold and rain.As the farm protests have grown in size in recent weeks, Mr. Modi’s government offered to amend some parts of the new laws, which it said were intended to inject private investment into the troubled sector. The country’s highest court also intervened, ordering the government to suspend the laws until it found a resolution with the protesters.But the farmers said they would not take anything less than a complete repeal, and pressed on with their tractor march into the city. The government even made a failed, last-ditch effort to get the high court to restrain the farmers on security grounds.Tensions were high leading up to Tuesday, with some officials claiming that the protests had been infiltrated by insurgent elements who would resort to violence. Just days earlier, the farmers’ leaders brought in front of the media a young man they claimed to have detained on suspicion of plotting to shoot the leaders and disrupt the rally. Neither set of claims could be independently verified.On the eve of the event, leaders of the farming unions insisted that they would carry out a peaceful march with about 150,000 tractors, and that more than 3,000 volunteers would ensure the routes negotiated with the Delhi police would be followed. Maps of the routes suggested a compromise that could allow the protesters to enter the city but not get close to sensitive institutions.The farmers even announced their next event: a march on foot to the Indian Parliament on Feb. 1, when the country’s new budget will be presented. Whether that protest will proceed after Tuesday’s violence was unclear.“Remember, our aim is not to conquer Delhi, but to win over the hearts of the people of this country,” the farmers said in instructions posted online for marchers, who were told not to carry weapons — “not even sticks” — and to avoid provocative slogans and banners.“The trademark of this agitation has been that it’s peaceful,” Balbir Singh Rajewal, one of the movement’s main leaders, said late Monday. “My request to our farmer brothers, to our youth, is that they keep this movement peaceful. The government is spreading rumors, the agencies have started misguiding people. Beware of it.”“If we remain peaceful, we’ve won,” he added. “If we turn violent, Modi will win.”But soon into the march, it became clear the leaders had lost control.At the city’s border with the village of Ghazipur, one of the spots where farmers have camped, tractors pushed aside a shipping container blocking their route as the police stood by. Elsewhere, thick clouds of tear gas rose over approved march routes as farmers on tractors, horseback and foot forcefully began their rally hours ahead of schedule, or tried to go off the ring road and push their way toward the city center.“What will the government do now?” said Anil Kumar, 52, an electrician who watched the chaos from the roadside with his 6-year-old son. “Even if you are in a family and three people agree with something and one person doesn’t, you have to find a way. The laws might be good. But if you are the prime minister, in a big position, you have to convince these people.”Large groups of tractors and protesters broke away from the approved protest routes — tipping over buses and clashing with overwhelmed police officers armed with bamboo batons — as they marched toward central Delhi.The Delhi police commanders deployed officers with assault rifles deeper into the routes as they tried to guard key roads. But they appeared to be outnumbered and largely helpless. In some areas, police officers beat protesters with their sticks to push them back.The farmers managed to breach the Red Fort, the iconic palace that once served as the residence of India’s Mughal rulers, and hoisted a flag atop the fort that is often flown on Sikh temples. A large number of the protesting farmers are from Punjab, a predominantly Sikh part of the country. Many carried long swords, tridents, sharp daggers and battle axes — functional if largely ceremonial weapons customary to some Sikh sects.Many of the protesters were maskless, shunning a basic protection against Covid-19 infection that risked turning the march into a super-spreader event.By noon, some wondered if the tractor march was actually a ploy by the farmers to finally enter the capital and stay until their demands were met. In a movement that felt leaderless, some of the protesters suggested that was exactly their wish.“Once we make it inside Delhi, we’re not going anywhere until Modi repeals the law,” said Happy Sharma, a farmer from the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh who was among 27 people riding in a trailer behind a tractor. “Modi is a thief!”“No, Modi is not a thief,” another farmer next to him interrupted. “He is surrounded by thieves who have him by the neck.”Some of the most violent clashes occurred at a junction near India’s income-tax office and an old headquarters of the police force as protesters tried to force their way toward the city center. Angry farmers retreated and drove their tractors on a side road that led away from the city, only after the police fired several volleys of tear gas.Local television channels showed farmers placing the body of a protester in the middle of a road nearby. They said the man had been shot, but that could not be independently verified. New York Times reporters in the area saw wounded people carried away who said they had been hurt when a tractor tipped over. CCTV footage that aired on local television showed one tractor flipping after crashing into a police barricade at high speed.Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Investigators Eye Right-Wing Militias at Capitol Riot</title>
	<author>Alan Feuer</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — F.B.I. agents and prosecutors investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol have increasingly shifted their attention to dangerous right-wing extremist groups, arresting several people in recent days suspected of taking part in the violence and of possessing ties to notorious militias such as the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters.The spate of arrests helps fill in a more complete picture of the mob that stormed the Capitol after being incited by President Trump on Jan. 6 in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College victory of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.The arrests, in Ohio, Colorado, Indiana and Texas, came as investigators gathered evidence to determine whether any of the groups had planned ahead of time to attack the Capitol. Videos and photos have revealed chilling scenes of rioters weaving through the mobs inside the building in tight formation, wearing tactical gear, carrying restraints and using hand signals and hand radios to communicate.Militia groups have a long history of taking part in anti-government events and right-wing political protests. The Oath Keepers are an anti-government, pro-gun militia composed largely of former law enforcement and military veterans “who believe that the federal government has been co-opted by a shadowy conspiracy that is trying to strip American citizens of their rights,” according to the F.B.I. The name of the Three Percenters, an anti-government group, is a reference to the purported 3 percent of the American colonial population that rose up to fight the British Army in the Revolution.Washington remained on edge on Monday as the Capitol Police issued a lockdown order at the Capitol for 45 minutes after a small fire was spotted in the area. Thousands of National Guard troops lined the heavy steel fences surrounding the building with unloaded assault rifles and others patrolled as the area remained under heavy security two days ahead of the inauguration.The pace of arrests and criminal charges continued unabated with F.B.I. agents fanning out across the country to track down rioting suspects. Agents have made at least 70 arrests, opened more than 300 investigations and gathered about 140,000 media tips as law enforcement officials monitored social media for word of more unrest or coordinated attacks.The highly visible investigation has set off alarm bells among far-right groups, already prone to conspiratorial thinking, with some now worried that online chatter about protests and other pro-Trump activities is a trap set by the government to apprehend them, according to a person briefed on intelligence about the groups.Prosecutors were making a top priority of focusing on militia members and other extremists and would build more serious sedition and murder cases against such groups if the evidence permits, Michael R. Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, said last week.“All of these extremist groups are being looked at in terms of their participation at the Capitol,” he told reporters.The federal authorities have prioritized not only militias but others who were involved in attacking police officers. The F.B.I. has also arrested members of the Proud Boys, a far-right nationalist group.On Sunday evening, Donovan Crowl, 50, a former U.S. Marine, and Jessica Watkins, 38, an Army veteran, surrendered to the authorities in Ohio after they published photos of themselves on social media wearing combat gear and saying that they had stormed the Capitol. They were charged in a criminal complaint with unlawful entry, disorderly conduct and obstructing an official proceeding.The F.B.I. said Ms. Watkins considered herself the commander of the Ohio State Regular Militia, which is affiliated with the Oath Keepers. In a social media post by Ms. Watkins, Mr. Crowl was depicted with the caption: “One of my guys at the Stop the Steal Rally today.”Federal prosecutors also unsealed charges this weekend against Robert Gieswein, 24, of Woodland Park, Colo., who they say is affiliated with the Three Percenters.Mr. Gieswein, who runs a private paramilitary training group called the Woodland Wild Dogs, was among the early wave of invaders to breach the Capitol, court papers said. Photographs from the attack show him clad in a military vest, goggles and an Army-style helmet, wrestling with Capitol Police officers to remove metal barricades and brandishing a baseball bat. In a criminal complaint, prosecutors cited a video of Mr. Gieswein encouraging other rioters as they smashed a window at the Capitol with a wooden board and a plastic shield and then climbing through the broken glass into the building.Mr. Gieswein was photographed inside the building with another suspect, Dominic Pezzola, a former Marine and member of the Proud Boys, who was charged last week.After the assault, Mr. Gieswein said in a news documentary interview that he attacked the Capitol to “get the corrupt politicians out of office,” according to court papers, adding, “They have completely destroyed our country and sold them to the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.” At least four people suspected of being in the Oath Keepers have been arrested, including Jon Schaffer, an Indiana musician, who surrendered to the F.B.I. He was seen donning a hat that said “Oath Keepers Lifetime Member.” Larry R. Brock, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel from Texas, was videotaped inside the Senate gallery wearing a helmet and holding flex cuffs. He apparently aligned himself with both the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.More recently, the founder of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, appeared on the conspiracy theory media outlet Infowars shortly after the election, claiming that his group was ready to attack Washington in defense of Mr. Trump. “We’ll also be on the outside of D.C., armed, prepared to go in, if the president calls us up,” he said.On Saturday, the F.B.I. arrested Guy Wesley Reffitt of Texas and charged him with obstruction. The bureau said he belonged to the Texas Freedom Force, a militia extremist group, while Mr. Reffitt’s wife said he was a member of the Three Percenters. Video shows Mr. Reffitt outside the Capitol on Jan. 6 wearing a black helmet and a tactical vest with a camera mounted on it.In an interview with the F.B.I., Mr. Reffitt’s son said that his father told him to “erase everything” because agents were watching him. Mr. Reffitt warned his children: “If you turn me in, you’re a traitor and you know what happens to traitors … traitors get shot,” according to the F.B.I.When agents searched Mr. Reffitt’s home, they found two weapons, a long gun and a pistol. Mr. Reffitt admitted taking the handgun to Washington but said he had disassembled it. He told agents that he went to the Capitol but did not go inside.In recently issued intelligence bulletins, federal authorities have said the deadly attack on Congress is expected to be a “significant driver of violence” for armed militia groups and racist extremists in the days ahead. The storming of the Capitol is expected to serve as powerful propaganda that fuels the far right and its violent tactics for years to come, according to hate group experts.Racist extremists and antigovernment militias like those seen at the Capitol attack “likely pose the greatest domestic terrorism threats in 2021,” experts have warned.Other arrests were made in the riot that did not include links to violent militias. Riley June Williams of Harrisburg, Pa., was charged after a tipster told the F.B.I. that she had been inside the Capitol and stolen Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s computer from her office. The tipster told the F.B.I. that Ms. Williams might be planning to send it to a friend in Russia who would sell it to the Kremlin’s foreign intelligence service, the S.V.R., though the bureau offered no additional evidence for the claim in court documents.The F.B.I. said that Ms. Williams had traveled to Washington with her father and the two later returned home. After the attack, Ms. Williams changed her phone number and deleted her social media accounts, and her mother told F.B.I. agents that she had fled town, according to court papers.The bureau did not provide any additional information on the whereabouts of the laptop, and the matter remains under investigation. Ms. Pelosi’s staff has said the laptop was used only for presentations.Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Your Evening Briefing: Inauguration and Executive Orders</title>
	<author>Judith Levitt</author>
	<body>(Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Inauguration week dawns in an occupied city.The nation’s capital has been secured with checkpoints, tens of thousands of National Guard troops and miles of fencing and barricades — security at the cost of normalcy.Thousands of troops have poured into Washington, where armored military trucks are parked in the middle of streets to block traffic, and where subway stations and roads are closed. Above, a rehearsal outside the Capitol today.In the aftermath of the Capitol riot, the Justice Department has charged suspected members of the Three Percenters, a militia group that emerged from the gun-rights movement, and of the Oath Keepers, a militia group founded by law enforcement and military veterans, as it works to determine whether the extremist groups conspired to attack Congress.Ahead of the inauguration ceremonies on Wednesday, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris today became the former U.S. senator from California, after resigning from her seat.Three new Democratic senators — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff from Georgia, and Alex Padilla, California’s secretary of state, who is set to replace Ms. Harris — may be sworn in as early as this week.2. Lawmakers are set to return to the Capitol.But it remains unclear when Speaker Nancy Pelosi will formally send to the Senate the article of impeachment charging President Trump with “incitement of insurrection.” Above, National Guard troops outside the Capitol today.President-elect Joe Biden has said he hopes the Senate can hold an impeachment trial while also confirming his administration nominations and moving forward with pandemic relief legislation.Janet Yellen, Mr. Biden’s choice for Treasury secretary, will tell lawmakers on Tuesday that the U.S. needs robust fiscal stimulus measures to get the economy back on track — and that now is not the time to worry about the nation’s mounting debt burden.Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, will not be taking part in the president’s defense in the Senate trial for his second impeachment, a person close to Mr. Trump said. It is unclear who will step in, given that many lawyers have privately said they won’t represent the president.3. Joe Biden plans to issue dozens of executive directives in a 10-day blitz.The orders will include canceling the Keystone XL pipeline permit on his first day in office, reversing President Trump’s approval of a project to move oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.Environmentalists have long targeted the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline as a contributor to climate change and a symbol of the country’s unwillingness to move away from oil energy.Other orders expected on Mr. Biden’s first day: rescinding the travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries, rejoining the Paris climate change accord, issuing a mask mandate for federal property and interstate travel, and ordering agencies to reunite children separated from their families after crossing the border.4. Los Angeles County became the first in the U.S. to surpass one million recorded coronavirus infections, and California is the first state to have more than three million cases. Much of the state is under a stay-at-home order.It’s part of a national picture: Nearly one year after the virus was first detected in the U.S., the country has reached 24 million cases and is hurtling toward 400,000 total deaths. Above, motorists in line for virus tests in the Dodger Stadium parking lot in L.A.Around the world, governments and public health organizations responded slowly and ineffectually to the outbreak, according to an interim report by a World Health Organization panel that described a yearlong cascade of failures.5. A judge ordered the Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny to be jailed for 30 days.Mr. Navalny, who spent months abroad recovering from a near-deadly poisoning, was arrested at a Moscow airport on Sunday as he arrived back in the country, on accusations of violating the terms of an earlier suspended prison sentence. He spent the night at a nearby police station without access to a lawyer, then was ordered jailed until Feb. 15.Labs in Germany, France and Sweden determined he had been poisoned in August by a nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union and Russia. Above, Mr. Navalny after the ruling.Long one of the most prominent critics of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Mr. Navalny called for protests in a video message moments after today’s order. “Take to the streets,” he told supporters. “Don’t do it for me, do it for yourselves and for your future.”6. Since July, the Trump administration has executed 13 inmates.That is more than three times as many as the federal government had put to death in the previous six decades, spurring the Supreme Court’s liberal justices to question the court’s role in rejecting stays of execution. Above, security fencing around the Supreme Court building.In a dissent issued late Friday, as the court cleared the way for the last execution of the Trump era, Justice Sonia Sotomayor took stock of what the nation had learned about the Supreme Court’s attitude toward the death penalty.“Over the past six months, this court has repeatedly sidestepped its usual deliberative processes, often at the government’s request, allowing it to push forward with an unprecedented, breakneck timetable of executions,” she wrote.7. “I let you down.”Days after Klete Keller, 38, an Olympic gold medalist in swimming, was spotted in videos of the pro-Trump crowds that assaulted the Capitol, friends and former teammates turned him in to the F.B.I.While Keller is not accused of doing anything violent, his acquaintances were still at a loss to explain his behavior. They also noted that he had personal struggles away from the pool.A former coach who spoke with him after his arrest said Keller was chagrined. “He kept repeating, ‘You’ve done so much for me, and I let you down,’” the coach said. “He kept saying over and over, ‘I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.’”8. Scared of hip surgery?Our Personal Health columnist, Jane Brody, says that improved surgical techniques and artificial hips that resist mechanical failure have been game changers for people with degenerated joints that are in serious need of replacement.The essential fact of hip replacement has not changed. But computer-assisted surgery and robotic arms help doctors expose less tissue, leading to rapid discharge, faster return to function, and diminished need for pain management.Robot-aided hip surgeries are typically not covered by insurance today. But as patients have faster and easier recoveries, with fewer complications, the economic advantages of robotic procedures are expected to change the insurance picture.9. The mystery of the painting thieves love.What is it about a Frans Hals painting housed at a tiny Dutch museum that has made it so popular with thieves?“Two Laughing Boys With a Mug of Beer,” a painting by Frans Hals, went missing for the third time since 1988 when the work, conservatively valued at more than $10 million, was stolen in August.Does its brushwork contain some clue to hidden treasure, or a secret code? Could it be coveted by some cult that worships Hals, or perhaps beer?Probably, experts say, the answer is more pedestrian: “They know they can get money out of it from somebody,” said the founder of Art Recovery International.10. And finally, the car races are digital, but the money is real.Simulated racing video games, where digitized cars obey the laws of physics and race on reproductions of real tracks, have been around for a couple of years.But after the pandemic struck, NBC and Fox experimented by replacing canceled auto races with sim races. Sponsors signed on and organizers awarded big prize money to the winners. Above, an eNASCAR race in May.The experiment seems to be paying off in sizable TV and web audiences. Will sim race fans still be aficionados when real cars hit the pavement again? Time will tell. But Fox has scheduled five sim races for its FS1 network this year.Have a revved-up evening.Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.Want to catch up on past briefings?

	<title>They Played the Game: Hall of Fame Poll Lets Players Decide</title>
	<author>Tyler Kepner</author>
	<body>There is only one sure way to become an eligible voter for the Baseball Hall of Fame: compile 10 consecutive years of membership in the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. A different group considers managers, umpires, executives and long-retired players, but since its founding in 1936, the Hall has always asked writers to be the primary judges for the game’s highest honor. The latest election results were announced on Tuesday, with no players being elected for the first time since 2013.Yet not even the most experienced, well-sourced writer could understand the game as well as a player. What if voters came from the dugout instead of the press box? Perhaps, with their intimate perspective, players could more easily agree upon selecting the best of the best.“I think they absolutely would come to more of a consensus,” said Ben Davis, a former catcher for San Diego, Seattle and the Chicago White Sox. “You know who the best guy in your league is. When you’re going through your game plan, there’s always one guy you will not let beat you. It’s the same for each team.”Ryan Spaeder, an author and statistician, has been seeking such opinions for the last few years, inspired by a conversation with Kevin Youkilis, the former All-Star infielder. When Youkilis suggested that anyone with major league experience should have a vote for the Hall of Fame, Spaeder decided to poll as many as he could find.As of Monday afternoon, Spaeder had gotten 76 players to participate in this year’s poll, from Hall of Famers like Carlton Fisk and Larry Walker to players with brief careers like Steve Holm and Bucky Jacobsen. In Spaeder’s poll, only three candidates reached the 75 percent threshold for induction: Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Todd Helton.The early returns among the writers at that point had yielded a different, somewhat unlikely, choice: Curt Schilling, the power pitcher, postseason stalwart and vocal critic of the news media who has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory. Among the 182 B.B.W.A.A. votes made public by late Monday afternoon — as tallied by Ryan Thibodaux on Twitter — only Schilling was polling above 75 percent, though Bonds (72.5 percent) and Clemens (72) were close behind. Schilling eventually fell short, getting 71.1 percent of the vote. Bonds and Clemens also fell short of election.Some voters have opted out of the process, citing the difficulty in applying the Hall of Fame’s character guidelines to players who used performance-enhancing drugs, especially in the era before testing. Some organizations, like The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, prohibit writers from voting for awards, believing that writers should report the news, not make the news.Writers who do not disclose their ballots tend to be more selective, so most players’ support declines when the full results are released. Between the polls, though, the difference between player and writer opinions is not as pronounced as it seems.No candidate reached 80 percent among either voting group. The candidates in the 40-49 percent range among writers (Gary Sheffield, Billy Wagner, Andruw Jones and Omar Vizquel) were grouped between 53 and 65 percent among players — better, but still short of the requirement for induction. Helton, the longtime Colorado Rockies slugger who played home games in a hitter’s paradise, got much more support from players than from writers, but he had also gained more new votes among returning writers than any other candidate and was polling above 50 percent in his third year on the ballot.“Just like you can’t control who you play on the schedule, you can’t control WHERE you play when you get drafted,” Schilling wrote on Spaeder’s site. “He performed to a Hall of Fame level across an incredible career. He also gets far less recognition as a defender than he should.”Fisk told Spaeder he would vote for Schilling, Vizquel, Wagner, Mark Buehrle, Torii Hunter, Andy Pettitte and Aramis Ramirez — leaving off Bonds and Clemens. Walker selected the maximum 10 candidates, including Bonds and Clemens, but two Hall of Famers — who asked Spaeder to remain anonymous — were stingier. One voted only for Helton, Vizquel, Scott Rolen and Jeff Kent, and another replied, “I wouldn’t vote for anybody on the current list of eligibility.”Eric O’Flaherty, the former reliever, acknowledged being torn about voting for players tied to steroids, but said the widespread use of amphetamines also gave players an edge. Since voters have roundly ignored the use of those drugs — also known as greenies — he could not penalize players for using other performance-enhancers.“I usually wind up feeling like the steroid guys should get in because I took a greenie once and felt like I could build a spaceship three minutes later,” O’Flaherty wrote, in explaining his ballot on Spaeder’s website. “I pitched that day, and I had an easy inning and would have gone 12 more innings if they let me.”O’Flaherty also voted for Schilling, explaining simply: “he was really good at baseball.” No player addressed the specifics of Schilling’s controversial social-media presence, though only 57.9 percent voted for him, compared to 75.3 percent of writers.Schilling himself voted for Helton, Jones, Kent, Rolen, Vizquel, Wagner and Bobby Abreu, providing an array of statistics to Spaeder and emphasizing the importance of defense, especially with Rolen and Vizquel.“If defense matters, which it does way beyond what Hall of Fame voters consider, then they are both locks,” he wrote.John Baker, a former catcher for the Marlins, the Padres and the Cubs, included five players linked to performance-enhancers — Bonds, Clemens, Sheffield, Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa — among his 10 selections. It would be naïve, Baker wrote, to assume that all current Hall of Famers were spotless.“How do you think people played for like 20 years, chocolate milk?” he wrote, adding later, “Induct Bonds and Clemens, bring Sammy back to Wrigley (and into Cooperstown), and have a willingness to sit with the idea that context and nuance are important for growth and understanding.”Baker called Bonds the greatest hitter who ever lived, pointedly noting that baseball was not integrated when Ted Williams began his career in 1939. Davis said the exclusion of Bonds was baffling.“The fact that Bonds isn’t in just blows my mind, it really does,” he said. “You can say what you want about whatever he took, but he’s the best baseball player to ever walk the earth, period. It’s not even close.”Plenty of writers share that opinion, but not enough for Bonds, Clemens — or anyone else — to get the call of a lifetime on Tuesday.</body>

	<title>Colombians Ask: Who Would Dare Patent Panela?</title>
	<author>Jennie Erin Smith</author>
	<body>VALLE DEL CAUCA, Colombia — This past April, Jorge González Ulloa, a shareholder at one of Colombia’s largest sugar companies, was awarded U.S. Patent No. 10,632,167, which described a method for making an unrefined sugar containing high levels of policosanols, alcohols found in sugar cane wax that are purported to lower cholesterol.The method, Mr. González’s patent claimed, would result in “a cholesterol-lowering consumable product at such a low cost that it could be made readily available to all individuals, particularly the millions of people that currently do not have the financial means to afford existing pharmaceutical drugs.” Raw sugar, Mr. González was proposing, would become the Lipitor of the poor.Mr. González has now applied for similar patents in Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Cuba, China, Australia and the European Union, and has trademarked a name for his product, calling it Policane.But to Colombians, the process for making Policane rings suspiciously familiar. It is indistinguishable from that for panela, a sweetener made here since the arrival of the Conquistadors. Unlike what Americans know as brown sugar, which is refined sugar with molasses mixed in, panela is traditionally made by boiling fresh cane juice in metal pots set over an oven fueled by the dried fiber of pressed cane. The result is a solid sugar with a subtle molasses-caramel flavor and slight mineral aftertaste. Its color ranges from a blond to a deep coffee brown.Equivalents of panela can be found across Latin America and Asia under different names. But Colombians consume more of it than anyone: a full pound per person per week, according to Fedepanela, Colombia’s national federation of panela producers. At just pennies a cup, “agua panela” — panela dissolved in hot water — is an essential source of calories for working people, especially in the countryside. Farm hands drink it morning and night. Babies are fed it mixed with milk, and the sick receive it with lime and ginger.Lately, the coronavirus pandemic has caused consumption to increase, because of its perceived healthful properties — panela, as its producers are quick to point out, contains trace minerals and vitamins, which refined sugar lacks. So distinct are the two products in the minds of Colombians that they are sold in different aisles of the supermarket. And so important is panela to Colombia’s rural economy that its nearly 20,000 producers, called trapiches, are protected by law from the incursions of sugar companies, which are not allowed to manufacture it.To patent a humble staple like panela struck Colombians as absurd, like patenting café con leche. News of the “panela patent” caused such an uproar in recent months that Riopaila Castilla, a sugar company based in Cali that until recently listed Mr. González on its board of directors, issued statements distancing itself from his efforts. Fedepanela has responded with an aggressive legal pushback, hoping to stop Mr. González’s patents from being approved in Colombia and abroad, and to revoke any issued in the United States.Panela producers have done much to cast their product as healthier than white sugar, perhaps setting the stage for someone like Mr. González to rebrand it as a “nutraceutical.” But to them, policosanols are a ruse — the goal is to patent all panela.Mr. González’s patent describes a lower-than-standard temperature for heating cane juice, to protect the integrity of the policosanols. But studies of conventionally produced panela have shown that it, too, contains policosanols — often high levels of them, said Néstor Triana, a chemical engineer with the federation. How much depends less on the temperature at which the juice is cooked and more on “the terrain, the nutrients it contains, and the variety of the sugar cane,” Mr. Triana said.As it happens, the scientific evidence for policosanols is poor to mixed. Studies from Cuba in the 1990s and early 2000s reported drops in LDL, or bad, cholesterol, while nutrition researchers elsewhere failed to replicate those findings. By 2010, research on sugar cane policosanols largely petered out, though supplements remained popular. Only lately have trials resumed; one Korean study recently reported a benefit. Even if policosanols were found to work, delivering them in sugar — which itself can alter lipid profiles unfavorably — might not be the best way to go.Mr. González, who did not respond to requests through intermediaries for an interview, has shunned the news media after claiming to a Cali newspaper last summer that he had invented “the healthiest sweetener in the world, and the cheapest.” Production was imminent, he insisted, but offered no hints as to who was making it or where.Colombia’s first sugar cane fields were planted nearly 500 years ago on the wide, flat banks of the Cauca River, by the current-day city of Cali. Today the region is still sugar country, where cane grows densely under big skies and a hot sun without too much help. Most of it goes to giant mills where table sugar is centrifuged and crystallized. The rest is for panela.Here many trapiches are industrialized, although the process is effectively the same as it was in the 16th century. Cane is cut by hand with machetes, and pressed into a muddy green juice that is filtered and boiled, with the fiber used for fuel. The thick syrup is poured into pans and frantically stirred as it cools into a fudge-like dough that is patted into form by a pesador, someone who intuits that each panela weighs what it is supposed to.“A good pesador is rare,” said Ricardo Bueno, the head of production at the La Alsacia trapiche in Tuluá, north of Cali. “We haven’t been able to technologize this.”On a visit last fall, employees in lab coats and hairnets monitored Brix levels — the amount of dissolved solids in a liquid, here a proxy for sweetness — as the juice evaporated in steel tanks, infusing the air with the smell of caramel. The food scientists analyze samples of cane before giving approval to harvest, but they often must make adjustments to the juice, tweaking its pH with calcium hydroxide and monitoring variations in the ratios of sucrose, fructose and glucose, which bear on the panela’s color.All this is to ensure that the final product, destined for supermarket chains, always looks and tastes the same — and won’t contain splinters or other unwelcome surprises that have been known to appear in more rustic versions of panela.Large trapiches like La Alsacia send increasing amounts of panela abroad; some 9,000 tons of it were exported in 2019, most to the United States and Europe, according to Fedepanela. The round loaves are sold in Latin supermarkets, while more popular is a cone shape labeled “piloncillo,” which is beloved among Mexican-Americans in California.Critics of Mr. González suspect that his patents are aimed, at least in part, at capturing these growing markets. Outside Colombia, no law would deter a sugar company from producing Policane. “What will happen if our Cuban friends in Florida decide to make it?” Javier Pérez, La Alsacia’s director, said.The Fedepanela lawyers would like to know how an ancestral process so richly documented in Colombia could have escaped the attention of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Not only do colonial-era records describe it in minute detail but technical universities all over the country also produce literature on panela.“This speaks to one of the weaknesses of patent examination practices,” said Polk Wagner, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Examiners are good at finding references to existing technologies when they are published in the United States, “but less so in foreign countries, in particular where the language is different.”In the mountains of Colombia’s Cordillera Occidental, just west of the Cauca River Valley, the small trapiches begin pressing and boiling cane juice before dawn, usually on a Thursday or Friday.Production starts when enough cane is piled up and eight or 10 workers can be assembled — every two weeks, for most. In some trapiches, the cane is hand-fed a few sticks at a time into a motorized press, while in others, the mill is powered by river water or by mules harnessed to a wheel.One worker feeds a voracious oven from piles of cane fiber. Another chops up a special wood pulp that pulls impurities to the surface of the juice. Syrup men skim the boiling juice with giant ladles, tossing steaming liquid from pan to pan until it becomes a thick, snapping caramel. There are no Brix monitors to show when it is ready — someone just dips a stick into it and submerges it in cool water, or uses his wet bare hand. Burns and other accidents are not uncommon.“Thankfully we’re seeing less of them,” said Álvaro Quintero, 34, a producer in the town of Versalles. His family’s trapiche is named after his grandfather, Don Manuel, and although it is a traditional operation without a food scientist in sight, it has some modern upgrades. The packing area is sanitized, with masks and gloves obligatory, and its steel and copper surfaces scrubbed. The finished panela gets loaded onto a 1967 Jeep to be sold in a neighboring town.Mr. Quintero, who represents the panela federation in this region, believes Mr. González’s patents threaten small producers as much as the large ones — particularly if a patent is approved in Colombia, where one is currently before the issuing agency.Just downhill was another trapiche, visible as a skinny smokestack poking out from the cane. Under its aluminum roof was a scene Mr. Quintero hates to see: shirtless men smoking as they worked, chickens pecking around, someone passed out on a pile of cane fiber, wooden pans that can produce splinters. But this was the reality of panela across much of Colombia, he conceded.It was 8 o’clock in the morning, and panela of an unusual, bright golden color was being stirred in pans when a pesador named Jimmy Buitrago showed up to work, late. He had been weighing panela at Don Manuel since 5 a.m., and before that at two other trapiches. He had not slept a full night in three days.Mr. Buitrago, a wiry 18-year-old, seemed no worse for the wear as he scooped the warm dough quickly to form perfect half-kilogram patties on a table, then stamped them with the initials of the trapiche’s owner. Between fresh pans of hot syrup he sneaked in bites of breakfast. He had been doing this for four years, he said.Mr. Buitrago was unaware of Mr. González’s efforts, or even what a patent was. Lucero Copete, who was packing the cooled patties in paper for market, explained it to him. “He wants exclusivity,” she said. Mr. Buitrago was incredulous: “Where’s he at?”This panela tasted different than the kind at the industrial plants: richer, smoother and off-the-charts sweet. “Well, of course!” said Mr. Quintero, pointing to a pile of ruddy gold stalks waiting to be pressed. “Look at the quality of the cane.”Panela is fussier and less predictable than table sugar, Mr. Quintero explained, because it contains all the components of the cane juice, not all of which can be adjusted. In small mountain plots like this, individual cane is selected for ripeness. The only additive is a little vegetable oil to keep the caramel from bubbling over.The policosanol content of this deliriously good panela remained undetermined, and the farthest it would ever get was just a few miles down the road.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]</body>

	<title>Hammered by Pandemic, N.C.A.A. Revenue Falls by $600 Million</title>
	<author>Alan Blinder</author>
	<body>The coronavirus pandemic fueled a $600 million plunge in the N.C.A.A.’s revenues during its most recent fiscal year, a staggering indication of how the pathogen forced a financial reckoning throughout a college sports industry that was already under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators across the country.The decision in March to cancel the men’s national basketball tournament cost the association $702 million in television and marketing rights, N.C.A.A. board members were told during a video call this month. And although the N.C.A.A. recouped some $270 million through insurance and spent about $473 million less, the association still posted a loss of nearly $56 million during the fiscal year that ended in August, meeting minutes show.The N.C.A.A. had planned to distribute $600 million to its Division I leagues last year, but ultimately paid out less than half of that.In an interview this month with The New York Times, Mark Emmert, the association’s president, referred to a range of financial backstops, including reserves and lines of credit, and budget cuts that had the N.C.A.A. operating with a staff roughly one-quarter smaller than it did a year ago.“And so we’re fine,” said Emmert, who paused for a moment before he completed the sentence. “We’re delivering all of the services that we need to — not always as fast as we’d like to, but we’re sure getting it done.”Emmert, who in recent months has overseen buyouts, early retirements, furloughs, budget cuts and salary and hiring freezes, said association leaders were not currently “contemplating” another reduction to the distribution to the N.C.A.A.’s leagues, which in turn share money with member schools.“We’re alive and well,” Emmert said. “We’ve got to get back to being able to support the schools, first and foremost, in the way that they all are accustomed to and require.”The pandemic came at a time when the N.C.A.A. was facing pressure in the courts and, perhaps most prominently, in Congress and the nation’s statehouses, where lawmakers were increasingly hostile to limits on how student-athletes could profit off their fame.The N.C.A.A. had been expected to approve new rules this month, but it delayed its plans after the Justice Department expressed misgivings in the waning days of the Trump administration. The delay angered lawmakers — and very well might have flared some interest in federal legislation on the issue of name, image and likeness — though N.C.A.A. officials insist that the association will ultimately act.Amid long political battles and their potentially seismic implications for the collegiate sports business model of students as amateur athletes, the N.C.A.A.’s abruptly troubled finances have become an urgent matter for the industry since March.In its fiscal year before the pandemic, the N.C.A.A. logged more than $1.1 billion in revenue, most of it related to broadcast and marketing rights of the 2019 N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament. It recorded a profit of nearly $71 million and ended the year with net assets of $450 million.By the end of the fiscal year that ended in August 2020, according to a financial statement obtained by The Times, the N.C.A.A. was down to about $394 million in net assets. Insurance proceeds accounted for more than half of its $519 million in revenue.And although the association’s liabilities ballooned from about $161 million to $307 million, auditors said the N.C.A.A. could quickly have about $641 million available to it, mostly through its vast portfolio of investments.In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, board members were told this month, revenues were down about 4 percent from the same period a year earlier, but that expenses had been cut by 15 percent.Although N.C.A.A. officials are bracing for a continuing decrease in championship revenues, they are moving ahead with plans for the men’s basketball tournament, the group’s financial lifeblood.Organizers have repeatedly and forcefully defended last year’s cancellation, which auditors said had cost the N.C.A.A. more than $800 million when ticket sales are included. There is also insurance in place for the 2021 tournament. But executives are well aware that missing another year of tournament revenues would substantially add to the association’s problems.In a bid to make the tournament happen in some form, officials have scrapped the coast-to-coast games that spread the tournament across the country each March and announced that the entire competition would be held in Indiana in March and April. Players, coaches, officials and others crucial to the tournament will be required to test negative for the virus on seven consecutive days before arriving in Indianapolis, and masks will be mandatory for people unless they are eating, practicing or playing, or are alone in their hotel rooms.The N.C.A.A. said last week that the tournament’s start would be delayed until March 18, two days later than initially planned.</body>

	<title>Men’s Wear Has an Emo Moment</title>
	<author>Guy Trebay</author>
	<body>Anybody in recovery could tell you that, for dealing with negative emotions, food or alcohol or drug addiction, there is a familiar and handy acronym known as HALT. The letters stand for a cluster of triggering feelings manageable if you can just tick through and address an inventory of basic human needs.One year into the pandemic, the whole strung-out world could probably use some form of H.A.L.T., not least designers charged with producing a vision of a future whose shape is impossible to discern. Thus, it was fascinating to learn from a variety of them how they’d coped with the long months of isolation — of being, in one form or another, Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired.Rick Owens spent what he called this “very, very dark” time at home in Paris contemplating masculine aggression, principally his own. Paul Smith passed 18 weeks alone in a souvenir-cluttered office at his London headquarters, where normally scores of people are employed, musing on the mods, the rockers, the hippies, the shifting fads and tumultuous events he has witnessed through five decades in fashion. Véronique Nichanian, the designer of Hermès men’s wear, found herself using the therapeutic powers of color to steady her through the jagged rhythms of serial lockdowns.Effectively grounded after years of ceaseless global travel, Virgil Abloh, the Louis Vuitton men’s wear designer, turned his consciousness inward to compose a kind of anchoring autobiographical mixtape spliced together from the varied pieces of a multi-hyphenated identity.Jonathan Anderson, shuttling on the Eurostar between London and Paris to produce two separate collections — one for his own label, JW Anderson, and another for Loewe — managed the stress of constant Covid-19 testing and risky travel by musing on root vegetables, handicrafts and George Ohr, the visionary American ceramist known as the “Mad Potter of Biloxi.”And they all cranked. What emerged from a week of collections experienced largely through video (although, as he did last season, Mr. Anderson trumped all things digital by producing fantastically conceptualized analog books) was a powerful sense of hive mind, of creative people as unalike as can be imagined unified by a belief in the power of making.Sure, there were the usual narrative conceits, the designer references and citations that can often seem plucked from some cultural go-bag (most absurdly, perhaps, at Louis Vuitton, where the theme of Mr. Abloh’s sixth collection was “Tourist vs. Purist” and the title of the show was “Ebonics’’). What stood out, though, was not the predictable mood-board cockamamie but emblematic images.At Mr. Abloh’s Vuitton show, for instance, there was the indelible vision of a model kitted out like some intergalactic cowpoke in a brightly patterned and quilted skirt suit adorned with a large cloth rose. On his head was a 10-gallon hat so wide brimmed it would make the average Stetson look like a beanie. Feet shod in embroidered steel-toed boots, he had beside him a quilted silver logo suitcase that made you want immediately to book a ticket to anywhere just for the thrill of wheeling it through an airport.At the JW Anderson collection, delivered as a series of posters photographed by Juergen Teller, Mr. Anderson’s continuing explorations of shape, proportion, texture and the crafts coalesced in the image of a pale starveling dressed in trousers whose widely flanged legs lent him a resemblance to a Watteau jester as reimagined by Braque.Covering the model’s top half was a shaggy vest of brightly dyed shearling; encasing his feet was a pair of blunt-toed loafers adorned with the Brobdingnagian buckles Mr. Anderson refers to as shoe jewelry.“I like the idea of humor in clothing,” Mr. Anderson said on a Zoom call, referring to the halved peaches he had printed on T-shirts and the bulbous cloth radishes he appended to sweaters and hoodies. Of the crocheted vegetables deployed throughout the collection, he said: “I spent a lot of the last year thinking about people making and doing.”Though the intense, almost meditative repose that arises out of the repetition of familiar gestures is not lost on those who have knitted or sewed or baked their way through the pandemic, it is not something one automatically associates with a designer as ostensibly hard-edge as Rick Owens.Yet, at various points during Mr. Owens’s show — filmed outside a Fascist-era war memorial on the Lido near Venice, where he spends his summers — the masked designer can be seen arranging and rearranging the models’ clothes before they exit with an intensity of focus that draws the eye away from everything else going on. There is not much about the designer’s gestures to suggest anything resembling masculine aggression. If anything, they seem maternal.In all likelihood it is the softness beneath the kinky, zippered bodysuits of leather; the quilted and hooded cashmere carapaces; the slashed overcoats and cow-skin platform boots made with the hairy side facing out that gives Mr. Owens’s ideas their tensile strength.He may create clothes capable of spooking you with their Sweeney Todd aura or look of flensed anatomies. But there is usually just enough revealed flesh to remind you of how nature goofed when evolving the human body as soft and furless and more vulnerable than we like to believe.Indomitable sunniness serves as a form of armor for Véronique Nichanian and Paul Smith, two designers seasoned by years of survival in a business that makes short work of anyone lacking a tough hide. Optimism is what each designer spoke about over the phone before their collections were shown last week, utilized as a strategy.“I wanted to look past the moment” and to anticipate the spirit of what comes next, Ms. Nichanian of Hermès said, invoking such a time with bright colors that to her symbolize hope.Reunited for a second time with the theater director Cyril Teste, Ms. Nichanian staged a version of a live show in some antechambers and around an interior staircase at the Mobilier National, a storehouse of state-owned furniture on the outskirts of Paris.Though a sectioned split-screen format provided multiple angles from which to view the clothes, it was hardly necessary. It is always clear in advance that whatever Ms. Nichanian produces will have a restraint it takes an assured hand to deliver and that, even when the stuff is as staid or workmanlike as the saddle-stitched parkas, piped blousons and elevated work wear she showed this time around, that is probably not a bad thing at a house where the watchword is continuity, not experimentation.Paul Smith, too, fell back on experiences accumulated over a half-century in the business to deliver a collection that shrewdly amalgamated elements from his own back pages, including suits that might have been designed for the Kray twins, mohair knits, high-waist mod trousers, plaid chore coats and dusterswell adapted for the post-office world. He explained his process with a common-sensical perspective that echoed the wisdom of H.A.L.T.“I was here in my office alone,” the designer said by telephone from London. “And I thought, ‘Well, I’m not going to museums or traveling, but I do have all these things around me in this room full of bicycles and books and stuff I’ve accumulated over the years.’” Sooner or later we will be released again into the wider world, he concluded.After doing an emotional check-in, he decided there were worse ways to cope than by rummaging around in memory’s familiar landscapes until then.</body>

	<title>E.U. Condemns Arrest of Navalny and Supporters but Takes No Action Yet</title>
	<author>Anton Troianovski</author>
	<body>BRUSSELS — Despite pressure from some European Union countries on Monday to sanction Russia further after the arrest of the Kremlin critic Aleksei A. Navalny and thousands of his supporters, the bloc’s top foreign policy official  will go ahead with a visit to Moscow early next month and meet with Russian officials first.The official, Josep Borrell Fontelles, will press the Russian government to release Mr. Navalny, according to diplomats in Brussels, and if not, new sanctions are possible. The decision came during a rare, in-person meeting of the European Union’s 27 foreign ministers in Brussels.Mr. Borrell’s trip to meet with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, is expected after Feb. 2, when Mr. Navalny faces a court hearing that could send him to prison for several years. His supporters have called for people to take to the streets again on Sunday, two days before the hearing.In a news conference, Mr. Borrell said the foreign ministers had condemned the Russian crackdown on Mr. Navalny and his supporters and called for their release. He said he would be pleased to meet Mr. Navalny, and his situation would be a topic of discussion during his visit, but the trip was primarily to discuss strategic relations with Russia before a summit of European leaders in March.European leaders are “ready to react’’ and to act “according to circumstances,’’ Mr. Borrell said. While the foreign ministers differed about how to respond to Moscow, there were no concrete proposals made, so there was no need to take decisions now, he said.Tens of thousands of Russians rallied for Mr. Navalny in the streets of more than 100 Russian cities last Saturday in the biggest demonstrations the country had seen since at least 2017. Several thousand were arrested and sometimes beaten, bringing protests from the new Biden administration as well as from European countries.The European diplomats discussed imposing fresh sanctions on Russia on Monday after pressure from several capitals for a tough line, but decided to wait to see what happens to Mr. Navalny and the outcome of Mr. Borrell’s visit.In October, the European Union imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute over the poisoning of Mr. Navalny in August with Novichok, a deadly nerve agent created in Russia during the Soviet era.In the latest sign of how Mr. Navalny’s campaign has shaken the Kremlin, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday took the unusual step of responding personally. Mr. Putin denied an extensive report by Mr. Navalny and his team that was released last week, after he was jailed, about the president’s purported “palace” on the Black Sea. The video has been viewed more than 86 million times on YouTube, underscoring the Kremlin’s vulnerability on the internet, which is mostly uncensored in Russia.“Nothing that is described as my property there ever belonged to me or my close relatives, and never did,” Mr. Putin said in a televised video conference with university students. The video alleged that the vast, lavish property, said to include vineyards and an underground hockey rink, was controlled by friends and close associates of Mr. Putin who were holding it for him.Mr. Putin said he had no time to watch Mr. Navalny’s 113-minute film in full, but had viewed excerpts. He dismissed it by quoting a line from “The Twelve Chairs,” an early Soviet novel: “Girls, this is boring.” Mr. Putin has used the line at least once before — to dismiss U.S. allegations of a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government in 2017.Threats of new sanctions are sure to be used by Russia’s state media to describe Mr. Navalny as a plant or tool of the West. Over the weekend, television news reports prominently featured tweets by Mr. Borrell and other Western officials as evidence that Mr. Navalny was working against Russian interests.On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the United States ambassador to Moscow, John Sullivan, to criticize the American response to the pro-Navalny protests. Maria Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, said that the support that the State Department had voiced for Mr. Navalny amounted to “direct interference in the domestic affairs of our country.”The new attention on Russia extends to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, owned by the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom and 94 percent finished, that the United States is trying to stop through sanctions imposed on companies helping to lay the last miles of pipes. The Biden administration has confirmed Washington’s opposition to the pipeline on the grounds that it benefits the Russian state, hurts the income of Ukraine and Poland and makes Germany more dependent on Russian natural gas.The Russians are preparing to lay pipes near Denmark with Russian-owned ships, while Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany continues to insist that the pipeline is a commercial venture and will go ahead, despite the poisoning and arrest of Mr. Navalny.Berlin is hoping to resolve the problem with Washington through negotiations with the Biden administration, but it is possible that a solution will include at least a temporary suspension of the project.The European foreign ministers are also under pressure to further sanction Turkey for its violation of waters claimed by Greece and Cyprus with warships and a ship designed to explore for natural gas. They have held off as Germany has tried to get talks going between Turkey and Greece on the dispute, which became dangerously heated last summer and remains volatile.As the European ministers met on Monday, diplomats from Greece and Turkey were also meeting in Istanbul for the first talks in five years aimed at resolving their longstanding dispute over sea borders. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had a good relationship with former President Donald J. Trump, is also seeking to establish better relations with the Biden administration.Even as they sit down to talks, officials disagree on what they will be discussing. Greece wants the conversation limited to the delineation of the countries’ continental shelves and corresponding energy rights — the focus of last summer’s dispute.But Turkey wants other areas of disagreement on the table, too, including the status of some islands in the Aegean and the rights of Greece’s Muslim minority in Thrace.At his news conference, Mr. Borrell also said the ministers expected Britain to grant full diplomatic status to E.U. representatives and that they looked forward to working with the new Biden administration.“Be sure we will coordinate much, much better than in the past,’’ he said.Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels and Anton Troianovsky from Moscow. Reporting was contributed by Melissa Eddy from Berlin and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.</body>

	<title>My Playbill Memories</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>To the Editor:Re “Piles of Broadway Memories,” by Maya Phillips (Critic’s Notebook, Jan. 19):When I read this essay and saw all the Playbills in the photo, I thought, That’s me!I still have all the Playbills from the many shows I’ve seen starting from when I was 13 years old. (I am now 83.) They are in a lot of boxes stored in my basement, and some are on display. (My son is a professional actor, so of course I have the Playbills from his Broadway shows more visible.)Years ago a friend of mine was moving from her home, and I visited to wish her good luck, and there they were: boxes of Playbills that she was going to “get rid of.” What was she thinking?I went into a frenzy and took all of them home with me!

	<title>With Impeachment Trial Looming, Republicans Waver on Punishing Trump</title>
	<author>Nicholas Fandos</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — For the second time in just over a year, the House on Monday sent an article of impeachment against Donald J. Trump to the Senate for trial, thrusting his fate into the hands of 50 Republican senators who for now appear reluctant to convict him.On a day marked more by ceremony than substance, nine House impeachment managers crossed the Capitol to inform the Senate that they were ready to prosecute Mr. Trump for “incitement of insurrection,” a bipartisan charge approved after the former president stirred up a violent mob that stormed the Capitol. But with some of the outrage wrought by the Jan. 6 rampage already dissipating, few Republicans appeared ready to repudiate a leader who maintains broad sway over their party by joining Democrats in convicting him.Senators planned to put off the heart of the trial until Feb. 9. That move will allow President Biden time to win confirmation of crucial cabinet officials and buy breathing room for Republicans to weigh their stances in what amounts to a referendum on their own futures and that of their party as much as on Mr. Trump.Unlike Mr. Trump’s last impeachment, when his party quickly rallied behind him, several Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, have signaled they are open to convicting the former president after his mendacious campaign to overturn his election loss turned deadly. That would allow the Senate to take a second vote to bar him from ever holding office again. But at least at the trial’s outset, their numbers fell well short of the 17 Republicans needed to join Democrats to secure a conviction.A survey by The New York Times on the eve of the trial found that 27 Republican senators had expressed opposition to charging Mr. Trump or otherwise holding him accountable by impeachment. Sixteen Republicans indicated they were undecided, and seven had no response. Most of those opposed increasingly fell back on process-based objections, rather than defending Mr. Trump.“Why are we doing this?” said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. “I can’t think of something more divisive and unhealing than doing an impeachment trial when the president is already gone. It’s just vindictive. It’s ridiculous.”Lawmakers in both parties cautioned that Republicans’ mood could quickly shift in the weeks ahead, if more evidence broke into public view about Mr. Trump’s actions or he provoked them further with his defiant threats of retribution.Already, unflattering new details were surfacing about Mr. Trump’s broader campaign to use his power stay in office at any cost. The Justice Department’s inspector general opened an investigation on Monday into whether current or former officials had tried to use their positions inappropriately to help Mr. Trump overturn the election outcome. The inquiry appeared to be a response to a report in The Times on efforts by a senior Justice Department official working with Mr. Trump to push top law enforcement officials to falsely and publicly use fraud investigations to cast doubt on the election outcome.With so much at stake, senators were moving with little precedent to guide them. Mr. Trump is the only president to have been impeached twice, and the trial will be the first in which the Senate has considered convicting a former president.With few Republicans ready to defend Mr. Trump’s actions, many have turned to arguing that the process itself is flawed because the Constitution does not explicitly say ex-presidents can be tried. Republicans have invited Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor, to expound on the argument at Republicans’ luncheon on Tuesday, and some were bracing for Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, to try to force a vote to toss out the case for that reason during Tuesday’s session. Such a vote would fail, but could provide an early gauge of Republicans’ views on the trial.“We will listen to it, but I still have concerns about the constitutionality of this, and the precedent it sets in trying to convict a private citizen,” said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa.She added: “He exhibited poor leadership, I think we all agree with that. But it was these people that came into the Capitol, they did it knowingly. So they bear the responsibility.”Irked by senators flocking to procedural claims that the trial was unconstitutional or unfair, Democrats warned Republicans that they could not hide from a substantive verdict.“There seems to be some hope that Republicans could oppose the former president’s impeachment on process grounds, rather than grappling with his awful conduct,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader. “Let me be perfectly clear: This is not going to fly.”Mr. Biden, who has been reluctant to comment on the proceeding, told CNN on Monday that the trial “has to happen,” even if it will complicate his legislative agenda. But he cast doubt on whether enough Republicans would vote to convict to sustain the charge.That Republicans were going to such lengths to avoid discussing Mr. Trump’s actions underscored how precarious their political situation was. Few contest that Mr. Trump bears at least some responsibility for the most violent attack on the seat of American government since the War of 1812, and many privately blame him for costing them control of the House, Senate and White House. But he also remains a popular figure among Republican voters, and many lawmakers fear that he could marshal votes to turn them out of office should they cross him.“I guess it depends on what state you’re in and what phase in your career you are,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters with a chuckle when asked what would happen to Republicans who voted to convict.Mr. McConnell, who steered the president to acquittal a year ago, has largely left senators to navigate the proceeding on their own this time. He has made clear through advisers and calls with colleagues that he personally views Mr. Trump’s conduct as impeachable and sees the process as a possible way to purge him from the party and rebuild before the 2022 midterm elections. But he has not committed to voting to convict.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.At least a half-dozen or so Republicans appear ready to join him if he does, but dozens of others appear to be unwilling to break from four years of alliance with Mr. Trump.Carrying a slim blue envelope on Monday, the House managers, led by Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, walked the impeachment article through a Capitol where memories of the siege were still fresh. They started in the House chamber, where lawmakers had ducked for cover and donned gas masks as rioters tried to force their way in; past Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office suite, which was ransacked; through the Rotunda, where officers fired tear gas as they lost control over the throng; and into the well of the Senate chamber, where invaders wearing pro-Trump gear congregated, taking photos on the dais from which the vice president and senators had been forced to evacuate minutes before.After Mr. Raskin read the charge in full, the managers departed, leaving the matter to the Senate, which planned to reconvene at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday to issue a summons to Mr. Trump to answer for the charge. Senators were expected to formally agree to a schedule for the coming weeks and swear an impeachment oath dating to the 18th century to do “impartial justice.”Mr. Trump’s new defense lawyer, Butch Bowers, was said to be trying to line up at least one additional lawyer to join him, according to people familiar with the planning. He was also working with Jason Miller, an adviser to Mr. Trump, on a public-relations campaign.Other aspects of the trial began to come into focus on Monday as well. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Senate president pro tempore, said he would preside over the trial, assuming a role filled last year by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.The Constitution states that the chief justice of the United States presides over any impeachment trial of the president or vice president. But it does not explicitly give guidance on who should oversee the proceeding for others, including former presidents. Mr. Schumer said Chief Justice Roberts was uninterested in reprising a time-consuming role that would insert him and the Supreme Court into the political fight over Mr. Trump.The role was largely ceremonial in the first impeachment trial of Mr. Trump a year ago. But as the presiding officer, Mr. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, could issue rulings on key questions around the admissibility of evidence and whether a trial of a former president is even allowed under the Constitution. He will also retain a vote himself.The job could also have gone to Vice President Kamala Harris, in her capacity as president of the Senate. But there were clear drawbacks for Ms. Harris in overseeing a proceeding that is all but certain to be regarded by some as an effort by Democrats to use their newfound power to punish the leader of the rival political party.Mr. Leahy’s presence on the dais could open Democrats to similar charges from the right, particularly if he issues a contentious ruling, but officials said there was no clear alternative without the chief justice. In a statement, Mr. Leahy was adamant he would take “extraordinarily seriously” his trial oath to administer “impartial justice.”Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Emily Cochrane and Adam Liptak from Washington.</body>

	<title>Lesson of the Day: ‘China’s Oppression of Muslims in Xinjiang, Explained’</title>
	<author>Nicole Daniels</author>
	<body>Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021.Featured Article: China’s Oppression of Muslims in Xinjiang, Explained by Austin RamzyOn the last full day of the Trump administration, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that China was carrying out a genocide against Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in its northwestern region of Xinjiang. The use of the term genocide is significant as it marks a turning point in years of debate over how to name and punish Beijing’s human rights abuses.In this lesson, you will learn about what is going on in Xinjiang and why the State Department decided to use the term “genocide.” Then you will consider what the United States and the world should do to protect the Uighurs in China.The main article is written in a Q. and A. format using the following five questions:Where is Xinjiang and why does it matter to China?What is happening there?What are the camps?Why, in the U.S. view at least, do China’s actions in Xinjiang amount to genocide?How has the world responded?Even before reading the article, can you answer any of those questions? Have you heard about the oppression of Uighurs in Xinjiang? What do you already know about what is happening? Where did you get your information?Then, watch the short video below and write down one question you have about the repression of the Uighurs in China.Read the article, then answer the following questions:1. Why does Xinjiang matter to China? What makes this region different from other parts of the country?2. What are different components of China’s systematic campaign to repress the Uighurs?3. The article states: “Officials have held one million or more people in internment camps in Xinjiang.” What happens in these camps? Why are people sent to these camps? And what does the Chinese government say about these camps?4. What is the definition of genocide, in your own words? Why does the United States believe Chinese authorities have committed genocide?5. The article states that the “global response to the repression in Xinjiang has been relatively muted,” but it doesn’t provide details about why. Why do you think the world’s response to China’s repressive policies might be muted? How do you think the change in U.S. policy might make a difference?Part I: The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum explains the origins of the term “genocide”:The word “genocide” did not exist prior to 1944. It is a very specific term coined by a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin (1900–1959) who sought to describe Nazi policies of systematic murder during the Holocaust, including the destruction of European Jews. He formed the word genocide by combining geno-, from the Greek word for race or tribe, with -cide, from the Latin word for killing.While many of us may associate the term genocide with the mass murder of millions of people, like the Holocaust and the Cambodian genocide, mass murder is not the definition of genocide. Here is how the museum explains what is a genocide:Genocide is an internationally recognized crime where acts are committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. These acts fall into five categories:— Killing members of the group— Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group— Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part— Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group— Forcibly transferring children of the group to another groupIt took the U.S. State Department months to decide whether to label China’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang as genocide. Last year, a Canadian parliamentary subcommittee reached the same conclusion. President Biden said last year through a spokesman that the policies by Beijing amounted to “genocide.”Based on the definition of genocide and China’s policies you read about in the article, do you think the United States made the right decision in its determination of genocide? Why?Should other countries follow suit?Part II: In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide to try to prevent and punish actions of genocide whenever and wherever they take place.Now that the State Department has determined that genocide is taking place in China, how should the United States government adjust its foreign policy toward China?What should the world do to protect the Uighurs?About Lesson of the Day• Find all our Lessons of the Day in this column.• Teachers, watch our on-demand webinar to learn how to use this feature in your classroom.</body>

	<title>McConnell Relents in First Filibuster Skirmish, but the War Rages On</title>
	<author>Carl Hulse</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell on Monday dropped his demand that the new Democratic Senate majority promise to preserve the filibuster — which Republicans could use to obstruct President Biden’s agenda — ending an impasse that had prevented Democrats from assuming full power even after their election wins.In his negotiations with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new majority leader, Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, had refused to agree to a plan for organizing the chamber without a pledge from Democrats to protect the filibuster, a condition that Mr. Schumer had rejected.But late Monday, as the stalemate persisted, Mr. McConnell found a way out by pointing to statements by two centrist Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, that said they opposed getting rid of the procedural tool — a position they had held for months — as enough of a guarantee to move forward without a formal promise from Mr. Schumer.“With these assurances, I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement.Democrats had been anticipating a capitulation by Mr. McConnell and said they believed he had overreached in the negotiation.“We’re glad Senator McConnell threw in the towel and gave up on his ridiculous demand,” said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer. “We look forward to organizing the Senate under Democratic control and start getting big, bold things done for the American people.”But as in past fights over the filibuster, the outcome is likely to be only a temporary solution. As they press forward on Mr. Biden’s agenda, Democrats will come under mounting pressure from activists to jettison the rule, which effectively requires 60 votes to advance any measure, should Republicans use it regularly to stall or stop the administration’s priorities.Even some lawmakers who have backed the filibuster strongly said they could change their minds if Republicans engaged in constant obstruction.“I feel pretty damn strongly, but I will also tell you this: I am here to get things done,” said Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana. “If all that happens is filibuster after filibuster, roadblock after roadblock, then my opinion may change.”Mr. Tester is among those key to the rapidly developing showdown over the fate of the filibuster, the signature feature of the Senate — a once rarely employed weapon now used routinely to stall action in the gridlocked institution — that holds heavy consequences for Mr. Biden’s presidency.Mr. McConnell’s demand for a pre-emptive surrender on the filibuster had infuriated Democrats who regarded it as evidence that the Republican leader intends to obstruct Mr. Biden’s proposals on pandemic relief, immigration, climate change, health care and more.“Mitch McConnell will not dictate to the Senate what we should do and how we should proceed,” Mr. Schumer said Sunday. “McConnell is no longer the majority leader.”The stalemate created a bizarre situation in which most Senate committees were frozen under Republican control and new senators could not be seated on the panels even though Democrats now command the Senate majority.Beyond the immediate logistical effects, the feud reflected a challenging dynamic in the 50-50 Senate for Mr. Biden. By holding out against Democrats eager to take charge, Mr. McConnell was exercising what leverage he had. But he also foreshadowed an eventual clash in the chamber that might otherwise have taken months to unfold over how aggressive Democrats should be in seeking to accomplish Mr. Biden’s top priorities.Democrats say they must retain at least the threat that they could one day end the filibuster, arguing that bowing to Mr. McConnell’s demand now would only have emboldened Republicans to deploy it constantly, without fear of retaliation.“Well that’s a nonstarter because if we gave him that, then the filibuster would be on everything, every day,” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.&quot;At issue is a rule that is at the heart of the consensus-driven Senate, which effectively mandates that any legislation draw 60 votes to advance. But like everything else in the chamber, the rule itself is subject to change if senators agree. As the majority party, Democrats could move to eliminate the filibuster and force through a change to the rules on a simple majority vote — a move known as detonating the “nuclear option” — if all 50 of their members held together and Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tiebreaking vote.As chances rose over the past year that Democrats could win control of the White House and Congress, speculation mounted over whether they would take such action should Republicans dig in against Mr. Biden. But no one anticipated that Mr. McConnell would bring the fight to a boil right from the start by entangling the filibuster in the basic work of setting up the Senate for the next two years through what is known as an organizing resolution, which requires Senate approval.In calling for the Democratic commitment, Mr. McConnell noted that Democrats relied on the filibuster themselves when Donald J. Trump was president and Republicans held the Senate.“Democrats used it constantly, as they had every right to,” he said last week on the floor. “They were happy to insist on a 60-vote threshold for practically every measure or bill I took up.”Mr. Schumer said little of his strategy for rebuffing Mr. McConnell, other than calling his demand unacceptable. The new majority leader seemed to let Democrats and Mr. Biden, a former longtime senator who has been reluctant to overturn the filibuster, simmer over Republican tactics.Yet Mr. Tester made it clear that Mr. McConnell’s tactics could rapidly change his view of the issue.“But if, in fact, Mitch is going put up roadblocks and filibuster the organizing resolution, then I think Schumer has to take it to the floor,” Mr. Tester said.Mr. Manchin had not changed his position even though Mr. McConnell’s demand was preventing Mr. Manchin from taking the helm of a committee of his own. In a 50-50 Senate, his defection alone would prevent the elimination of the rule.“I’m in the minority of the caucus on this, I’m sure of that,” Mr. Manchin told reporters last week. “I think basically Chuck has the right to do what’s he’s doing. He has the right to use that leverage in whatever he wants to do. I’m not worried about that at all. They will work it out. I just haven’t changed where I’m at.”Still, Mr. McConnell appeared to have the backing of other Republicans, including moderates who are empowered by the 60-vote requirement, who said they too wanted assurances that Democrats would not upend the filibuster.“Including some kind of détente on the filibuster is important,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who said it was not an issue in 2001 because no one at the time would have contemplated eliminating it. “It was not even a subject that was even thought about, and so it’s a different environment.”As for Mr. Biden, the White House says his position in support of the filibuster has not changed, though he gave some mixed signals during the campaign. Mr. Schumer and Senate Democrats would be very unlikely to proceed with scrapping the practice without the endorsement of Mr. Biden, particularly because they would need Ms. Harris’s vote to do so.Mr. Tester said the filibuster had a role to play because it can lead to legislation that can “stand the test of time,” rather than lock Congress in a cycle where one party is always trying to undo partisan legislation passed by the other. But his patience is not infinite.“I didn’t come here to sit at my desk and wait for no votes to happen,” he said. Luke Broadwater and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Former T.S.A. Agent Convicted of Tricking Woman Into Showing Her Breasts</title>
	<author>Concepción de León</author>
	<body>A former Transportation Security Administration agent who was accused of deceiving a woman into showing him her breasts as she went through security at Los Angeles International Airport has been sentenced to 60 days in jail, the authorities said.The former agent, Johnathon Lomeli, 23, pleaded no contest on Friday to a felony charge of false imprisonment in connection with the episode, which occurred on June 10, 2019.A young woman, whom the authorities did not name, told investigators that while she was going through security at LAX, Mr. Lomeli said that he had to look inside her bra to make sure she wasn’t hiding anything, and then he had her pull her pants away from her waist so he could look down them, The Associated Press reported.Mr. Lomeli then told her that he was taking her to a private room for further security screening. Once they were alone in an elevator, however, he told her that he could do the screening there, the woman told investigators, according to The A.P.There, Mr. Lomeli told her to lift up her shirt “to show me your full breasts,” before again looking down her pants. He then told her that she had nice breasts before saying that she was free to go, the report said.Mr. Lomeli was arrested on Feb. 6, 2020, and resigned that day, the authorities said.In addition to the jail term, Mr. Lomeli will be on probation for two years and must take 52 classes to address sexual compulsion, the California Attorney General’s Office said in a statement on Friday.Mr. Lomeli, who will begin his jail term on Feb. 19, is also barred from working as a security guard and will be forced to pay restitution to the victim; the amount will be determined at a later hearing, the attorney general’s office said.“We all have the right to be treated with dignity and respect in all places, and no one is entitled to use a position of power to violate those rights,” Xavier Becerra, the attorney general, said in his statement. “Why can’t some men absorb that simple truth? This is 2021, not 1921.”Errol Cook, Mr. Lomeli’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a phone message on Monday afternoon seeking comment.Lorie Dankers, a spokeswoman for the T.S.A., said that the agency “does not tolerate illegal, unethical or immoral conduct.”“The actions involving a former T.S.A. employee are an affront to the hardworking and committed members of our work force,” Ms. Dankers said.</body>

	<title>Song Yoo-jung, South Korean Actress, Is Found Dead at 26</title>
	<author>Youmi Kim</author>
	<body>A 26-year-old actress was found dead on Saturday in Seoul, South Korea, the latest loss of a young performer in the country’s entertainment industry, which has faced a reckoning over the mental health burden on its glamorous stars.The death of the actress, Song Yoo-jung, who appeared in several television dramas, was confirmed in a statement by the company that represented her, Sublime Artist Agency. The agency did not disclose the cause, but the suddenness of Ms. Song’s death brought to mind the series of suicides that has plagued Korean pop music in recent years.Alarms have long been raised over the pressures imposed by South Korean management companies on young entertainers, many of whom are groomed starting as teenagers to be pop idols. Their looks are closely scrutinized, and their tightly choreographed lives are often broadcast on social media platforms that expose them to both adulatory fan mail and hateful comments.For many, their time in the limelight is limited, if they ever reach star status. By their late 20s, some are considered replaceable.A number of the K-pop stars who have taken their own lives spoke of struggles with their mental health and the toll of cyberbullying. Ms. Song, an up-and-coming actress, had not mentioned publicly any such issues.Ms. Song began her acting career at 20 and appeared in commercials for Estée Lauder skin care products and for the ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins. In her breakout role in 2019, Ms. Song played a fresh-faced architecture student with a pixie cut, searching for her soul mate, in a web series called “Dear My Name.” She also acted in music videos.She was an advocate for people with disabilities, serving as ambassador for a South Korean group called Warm Accompaniment.Ms. Song’s agency called her “a great actress who performed with passion.” It did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The problem of suicide in South Korea is not restricted to the entertainment industry. The country has the highest suicide rate among the 37 developed nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.But celebrity suicides, involving actors and others, have been a fixture in the South Korean news media over the past decade or more. In recent years, attention has fallen most sharply on deaths in the K-pop industry, one of the country’s most successful cultural exports.In 2017, a singer, Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself at 27 after leaving a note saying that he had been overcome by depression.In 2019, Sulli, a 25-year-old K-pop star, took her own life after she had complained about the relentless cyberbullying she faced upon joining a feminist campaign that advocated not wearing bras.About six weeks later, her friend Goo Hara, 28, also killed herself, leaving a handwritten note about her despair.Ms. Goo had tried to reason with online critics, asking them to refrain from vicious comments.“Public entertainers like myself don’t have it easy — we have our private lives more scrutinized than anyone else and we suffer the kind of pain we cannot even discuss with our family and friends,” she wrote.If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.</body>

	<title>For Frank Lampard and Chelsea, an Encore Without the Cheers</title>
	<author>Rory Smith</author>
	<body>LONDON — Frank Lampard had known about the banner for a couple of weeks. As Chelsea’s winter had turned bleak, as whispers that Lampard, its inexperienced coach, might be drifting toward the edge grew louder, word reached him that a group of fans — known as We Are the Shed, after Stamford Bridge’s most famous stand — had decided to offer a token of its faith.The fans had designed a flag in his honor, and intended to hang it from the stadium for the first time during Sunday’s F.A. Cup game against Luton Town. “In Frank We Trust,” it read, white letters on a blue field. There were stylized images of him celebrating in the club’s colors, both as a player and a manager. And underneath, three simple words: “Then. Now. Forever.”Lampard was, he said, touched by the gesture. “I don’t know if emotional is the right word,” he said, but he was certainly “appreciative” to see such proof of the two-way bond he had shared with the club’s fans for the better part of two decades. That was Sunday afternoon. He was fired on Monday morning.Lampard was not the first manager at Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea to come under what seemed, on the surface, to be an undue, premature sort of pressure. He is not the first to be unceremoniously dispatched as soon as the club sensed the first curling tendril of looming disappointment in the air. Nor, almost certainly, will he — or his probable replacement, Thomas Tuchel — be the last.Some of those who have gone before Lampard have done so with sympathy, perceived as victims of Abramovich’s ruthless impatience: Carlo Ancelotti, Antonio Conte, José Mourinho, the first time around. Others have found their farewells a little colder, their departures interpreted as inevitable and self-inflicted: André Villas-Boas, Luiz Felipe Scolari, José Mourinho, the second time around.But none — not even Mourinho, the greatest manager in the club’s history — have retained the support of the fans quite so unanimously as Lampard, the rookie coach who took a young team to fourth in the Premier League in his first, and only, full season at the club, but then, after the largest transfer expenditure of the Abramovich era, steered a lavishly gifted, well-tooled squad into ninth place.The banner provides the most eloquent explanation of that loyalty. Not just through the image of Lampard the player, the most productive goal-scorer in Chelsea history, a multiple winner of the Premier League and the F.A. Cup, a cornerstone of the team that turned the club into London’s first-ever European champion, or the reference to man and team’s shared past, but the fact that he knew the fans were planning it, too.He had been told the banner was coming by, as he put it, “the people directly involved” in making it. Lampard’s association with Chelsea runs long and deep enough that he has deep-seated, well-established connections with Chelsea’s fans.That would be an advantage anywhere, but it is particularly precious at Chelsea. Not for the manager — that Lampard was fired so soon after he was given such public backing illustrates, quite neatly, how little power fans have — but for the public itself.Chelsea’s fans have grown sufficiently accustomed to seeing managers come and go that, at times, they can harness Abramovich’s susceptibility to the slightest pressure to their own ends.Maurizio Sarri, who preceded Lampard, was hardly an unmitigated success, but his only season at Stamford Bridge was no overwhelming failure: His team finished third in the Premier League and won the Europa League. And yet, months earlier, some fans had been agitating for his dismissal. They had never taken to him, never bought into his style of play, and they knew that, at Chelsea, it does not take much to tip the balance.In that context, the fans’ desperation for Lampard can be read not just as hopeless sentimentality, but as a desire for some sort of constancy. For 18 years, Chelsea has staged an endless parade of managers: some young, some old, some exotic, some familiar. Each one has hinted at some new direction for the club. And yet none have stuck around for long.The riposte to any criticism of that approach has always been to point at Chelsea’s bulging trophy cabinet, but that is no longer as convincing as it once was. The cycle of boom and bust, crest and fall, has left the fans with a feeling of seasickness, rootlessness, one to which both the club’s supporters and its hierarchy hoped Lampard would be the balm.Lampard was, perhaps, the clearest example yet of soccer’s brief but ongoing belief that every club has within the ranks of its alumni some visionary who can do for them what Pep Guardiola did for Barcelona.Lampard had coached for only a season at Derby County, doing a fair but unspectacular job, when he was approached by Abramovich and pinpointed as the man to oversee a great reset, one that would rest on the Terracotta Army of players waiting in the club’s academy and would, at last, give rise to a style of play that was distinctively Chelsea.The problem with the Guardiola paradigm is that soccer uses it to draw the wrong conclusion. The lesson from the story of how the Barcelona academy graduate forged the greatest club team in history is not that any articulate former player, steeped in the values of a listing but willing superclub and given access to formidably talented teenagers, can conquer the world.It is, instead, the opposite. As his playing career wound down, Guardiola sought out all those coaches who had inspired him the most. He traveled to meet Marcelo Bielsa. He went to play in Mexico for six months to study under Juanma Lillo, now his assistant. He realized that who he had been as a player was not directly related to who he wanted to be as a coach.Lampard had not undergone that same process when Abramovich came calling. In his defense, it is possible that he simply had not had time. He had not, like Guardiola, set out to separate who he had been as a player from who he would be as a manager. He had not devoted the final few years of his former career to fine-tuning his beliefs and his style and his approach. He did not even see it as a career change, but rather an organic continuation.Lampard assumed — and Chelsea assumed — that the player celebrating on the left of the banner would naturally bleed into the manager celebrating on the right. Then would lead to now, and now would lead to forever. This season, both club and manager have learned it does not quite work that way.Chelsea might, in truth, have fired Lampard earlier. His colleagues, certainly, have been fearing it for weeks. At least one was convinced that he would not see out the season as early as October. Some, inside the club, advocated replacing him with Mauricio Pochettino, before the former Tottenham manager was snapped up by Paris St.-Germain.It is a measure of the affection Chelsea has for Lampard that it hesitated to toss him overboard. So, too, was the fact that Abramovich himself felt moved to explain the reasons behind his dismissal, the first public utterances he has made on any subject for some time. They desperately wanted him to succeed, for all that he had done for the club as a player. Ultimately, though, that did not matter, because ultimately, the memory of what he used to be was not in charge.</body>

	<title>A Monument Honoring Brooklyn Abolitionists Stalls Under Scrutiny</title>
	<author>Zachary Small</author>
	<body>When the artist Kameelah Janan Rasheed was commissioned to conceive of a project honoring Brooklyn abolitionists, she wanted to turn the idea of a monument on its head. She proposed to reinvent the design of the anticipated Willoughby Square Park in Downtown Brooklyn with pavement engravings and bronze placards, which would offer questions and prompts to highlight the borough’s antislavery movement and its legacy.But the preservationists and activists who, for 20 years, have pushed the city to honor Brooklyn’s abolitionist roots were displeased with Ms. Rasheed’s designs, complaining they were too abstract at a time when women and people of color are fighting to see themselves figuratively represented in New York’s monuments.“We are not going to settle for plaques and engravings, which people will walk right past,” said Shawné Lee, whose family helped ignite the neighborhood’s preservation efforts. “I want to see historical figures represented, because these days we need to see people who look like us in the city’s monuments.”Since at least 2019, Ms. Lee and other activists have proposed a monument including Black women like the educator and abolitionist Sarah J. Garnet and the investigative journalist Ida B. Wells. Ms. Lee is an owner of 227 Duffield Street in Downtown Brooklyn, a house adjacent to the park that historians now believe was part of the Underground Railroad. It is currently under review for landmark status after it was threatened by eminent domain to make room for the 1.15-acre park, whose completion is estimated in 2022. The city’s most recent plans expect that the building will be preserved.The confrontation played out last week during a meeting of the Public Design Commission, which reviews permanent monuments and works of art on city property. After listening to public comment, the commissioners voted unanimously to table Ms. Rasheed’s proposal, a $689,000 dollar project steered by the Department of Cultural Affairs and the city’s Economic Development Corporation.“We are not going to give approval until this process has moved further along,” said the commissioner Signe Nielsen at the meeting, adding that a later review would allow “greater opportunity for the artist to hear some of the voices that perhaps have not been heard.”The meeting was a turbulent introduction for Ms. Rasheed into the city’s public art process, which has become increasingly contentious under Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has commissioned nearly a dozen new monuments in the last two years through a program called She Built NYC.Critics have accused Mr. de Blasio of rushing to build monuments and speeding up the public review process as a way to affix his legacy on the city’s landscape. In 2019, the cultural affairs commissioner, Tom Finkelpearl, resigned from his post in the aftermath of another difficult artist selection process to replace a controversial statue in Central Park.But the city argues that it has followed the law for the public review of the monument at Willoughby Square Park. “Starting with a community presentation in August 2019, the artist selection process has been a rigorous and thoughtful engagement with the legacy of the slavery abolition movement of Brooklyn,” said Ryan Max, a spokesman for the Department of Cultural Affairs. “The selection of Kameelah Janan Rasheed marks the start, not the end, of involving the local community in a real, meaningful process.”Nevertheless, some city residents worry that the Willoughby Square Park commission lacks public accountability. Although the artist was selected nearly a year ago, Ms. Rasheed was not publicly announced as the competition’s winner until this month. (The city said that Covid-19 played a role in delaying its work on the project.)Ms. Rasheed, a former public-school teacher whose text-based banners recently decorated the Brooklyn Museum’s facade, is now looking for a path forward in collaboration with community stakeholders.“Having multiple pathways for engagement is the most important thing to focus on here,” she said at the design meeting. “This is just one project in a larger ecosystem of projects, which are trying to address questions around abolition.”According to public art experts, roadblocks within the Public Design Commission will yield another delay for the neighborhood’s $15 million park, a project that began under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg nearly 17 years ago as part of a larger $100 million plan to redevelop Downtown Brooklyn.Preventing the destruction of 227 Duffield Street, which was home to the abolitionists Harriet and Thomas Truesdell in the mid-1800s, has energized community advocates who have promoted the neighborhood’s role as a stop in the Underground Railroad. Recent efforts have included renaming Duffield Street as Abolitionist Place and installing a plaque to Ida B. Wells, who lived in the area and, in the 1890s, documented lynching in the South. The local community board has even renamed the park, but the city has not yet recognized it: Abolitionist Place Park.“Whatever we build in Downtown Brooklyn should rival the Statue of Liberty,” said Raul Rothblatt, who has fought to preserve the area’s history for nearly 20 years.He added: “But instead, the city is planning to build a dog park above where tunnels once connected abolitionist homes.”</body>

	<title>After Leaving Trump Property, P.G.A. Championship Lands in Oklahoma</title>
	<author>Bill Pennington</author>
	<body>The 2022 P.G.A. Championship, which was withdrawn from Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., days after a mob incited by the former president stormed the Capitol in a riot that resulted in the deaths of five people, has been awarded to the Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla.The P.G.A. of America, which conducts the tournament, one of the four major men’s golf championships worldwide, announced the new site for the event Monday in a brief statement. The tournament will be played next year from May 19 to 22.For many years, Donald Trump had publicly lobbied each of golf’s governing bodies to bestow one of the sport’s featured championships to one of his golf courses. The Bedminster club hosted the 2017 United States Women’s Open, and his club in Virginia was the site of the 2017 Senior P.G.A. Championship.The P.G.A. of America chose Trump Bedminster to host the 2022 championship in 2014, before Trump was a candidate for president. But on Jan. 10, the organization’s president, Jim Richerson, said in a video statement: “It has become clear that conducting the P.G.A. Championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the P.G.A. of America brand, and would put at risk the P.G.A.’s ability to deliver our many programs, and sustain the longevity of our mission.”The next day, the chief executive of the R&amp;A, the organization that conducts the British Open, said its flagship event would not return to Trump Turnberry, a golf course in Scotland owned by Trump, for “the foreseeable future.” Turnberry, purchased by Trump seven years ago, has hosted the British Open, the oldest of golf’s four men’s majors, four times, most recently in 2009. It previously hosted the Women’s Open in 2015.Robert Wood Johnson IV, the American ambassador to Britain during the Trump administration, told multiple colleagues in February 2018 that he had been asked to see if the British government could help Turnberry host the British Open again, according to three people with knowledge of the episode. The British government said Johnson made no request regarding the British Open and Trump denied asking Johnson to press such a move.While the resort was not scheduled to be the site of this year’s event, it was in consideration for the 2023 British Open.“We will not return until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself and we do not believe that is achievable in the current circumstances,” Martin Slumbers, the R&amp;A chief executive, said.Southern Hills has been the setting for four previous P.G.A. Championships, the last in 2007 when Tiger Woods won the tournament. The course also hosted three U.S. Opens from 1958 to 2001. Moving the P.G.A. Championship to Oklahoma also locates a men’s major in a noncoastal setting. This year’s U.S. Open will be contested near San Diego while the 2021 P.G.A. Championship will be held on Kiawah Island along the South Carolina shoreline.“Excited to return to SHCC for the fifth time,” the P.G.A. of America wrote on its website Monday. “The course offers a tough-but-fair test for the strongest field in golf.”Southern Hills was designed in 1936 but underwent an $11 million restoration led by the noted golf-course architect Gil Hanse two years ago.</body>

	<title>It’s 30 Degrees. Shall We Have Brunch Outdoors?</title>
	<author>Corina Knoll</author>
	<body>The macaroni and cheese flecked with fresh pepper was hot and comforting and paired nicely with the French beer — a Kronenbourg accompanied by a slice of orange peel. Served at St. James Gate on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, the meal perked up Genevieve Feldmann on Sunday even though she was dining outside. In 30 degrees.Layered in three coats, leggings under jeans and wool socks, Ms. Feldmann, 35, said the cold did not discourage her from making it to the pub, where she has become a fixture along with a crowd of other regulars eager to support the restaurant. It is one of her rare opportunities to be social, and she doesn’t mind dressing for the occasion.“The wind picks up, it gets a little chilly, but you know what, you just kind of deal with it,” said Ms. Feldmann, who works in equity research. “We all stick through it because this place is really special to us.”New York City, emptied of its tourists and foot traffic, can seem an especially barren place during the pandemic. The onset of winter’s chill has limited outdoor escapes, making quarantine feel even more cruel, particularly during those long stretches when there is only icy wind and no snow to soften the landscape.But there is life along the streets still: the die-hards who brave outdoor dining even when the temperature falls below freezing and a patio heater cannot shield them from a January breeze. Even at night, when the few degrees donated by the sun disappear, people arrive to shiver through dinner with numb fingers and toes.Outdoor dining was that summer boost that gave restaurants and their customers hope, but it was never clear what would happen when the weather turned. Now the answer can be seen in those dedicated to sallying onward through the frostiest of days.It is not what it was, but outdoor dining has managed to survive, with loyal patrons determined to save a restaurant, and friends who insist on finding a safe way to meet up. Restaurants have rallied to show their pluck, cranking up heaters, setting out fresh flowers, decking tables with cheery linens, stringing lights around sidewalk booths even as the city’s upcoming restaurant week is reimagined for takeout and delivery.For Ms. Feldmann, who lives down the block from St. James Gate, the pub has been a second home where she heads nearly every day. The staff knows her favorites on the menu, and she has managed to see more friends during the pandemic than before. Having a go-to spot has been life-changing since her office shut down and she began working from home, she said.Five blocks away at the Consulate, friends Katie O’Brien, 38, and Lauren Meyer, 39, arrived armed with hand sanitizer, hot water bottles and hand warmers to slip inside their gloves. They were happy to learn that the restaurant provided blankets, which they wrapped around themselves as they drank wine at a table near the entrance. When the hamburgers appeared, they took their gloves off and put them back on between bites.“I decided if I definitely wanted to go out, I just have to accept it’s going to be cold,” said Ms. O’Brien, who was celebrating her birthday.The two had looked at more than a dozen restaurants for seating that wasn’t enclosed and offered enough space between tables, wanting to be as safe as possible.Being social while cautious is on many diners’ minds as the number of coronavirus cases in New York increases. While the surge has not been as devastating as the one that the city experienced last spring, the death rate has slowly risen throughout January to about 60 people per day, and more than 50 ZIP codes in the five boroughs show a positive test rate over 10 percent.The city has also struggled with a sluggish vaccine rollout. In New York City, home to an estimated 8.5 million people, only about 532,000 first doses have been administered. Recently a vaccine supply shortage forced health officials to move scheduled appointments to a later date.Still, New Yorkers want to get out. In Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Maria Myrtil scouted out Sweet Brooklyn Bar &amp; Grill to see if it had safety protocols in place before making a reservation on Sunday to sit with friends inside a small plastic enclosure resembling a tiny greenhouse.Ms. Myrtil, 28, approved of the layout, which included a tabletop heater. She did, however, adjust her approach to ordering.“This used to be known for their bottomless brunch,” she said of the restaurant. “But how many mimosas do I really want when it’s 30 degrees outside?”Nearby, Virginie Guebie and Noel Campbell said they found themselves at Sweet Brooklyn after their plans to go into Manhattan for brunch were derailed by subway delays. The couple cooks a lot, but wanted a chance to leave their apartment.“Sometimes you want to just sit down and enjoy a meal without having to worry about washing dishes or what’s left in the fridge,” Mr. Campbell, 36, said.Ms. Guebie, 41, added, “You need to feel like you have a sense of normalcy.”Cold-weather patrons tend be particularly respectful, said Rebecca Brown, the manager of Chavela’s, a Mexican restaurant in Crown Heights.“People are almost too polite,” Ms. Brown, 37, said. “When you walk to the table, everyone scrambles to get their mask on. So I think there’s definitely an awareness that we’re here for them.”Outside, two dozen diners sat in new enclosures attached to the restaurant on both sides of its corner entrance, while other patrons waited on the curb in a scene approaching pre-pandemic Sunday brunch ritual.Annie Black, 31, arrived by herself for what was her second meal outside the home this winter. “I don’t mind the cold,” she said, “more, I just worry for everybody’s safety. But having a day date to yourself these days is a real treat.”At Hi-Life, a restaurant and bar on the Upper West Side, black tables sat empty as the lunch hour began. Still, the owner, Earl Geer, remained optimistic.“It’s about doing the best you can,” Mr. Geer, 63, said, sitting outside in a booth under his restaurant’s vintage neon sign. “It’s showing up with your best every day and putting one foot in front of the other, and in the end, that spirit will prevail.”Mr. Geer opened the place three decades ago, inspired by the Art Deco lounges of the 1930s. He takes pride in the fact that his establishment has never closed — not on Sept. 11, not during the blackout of 2003 and not during Hurricane Sandy. He credits his employees and family members for carrying the restaurant through a string of rough patches, including the Great Recession, although nothing has been quite like the pandemic, which Mr. Geer described as “a new adventure in survival.”But even the onset of winter has not shaken his hope in customers who seem to recognize their role in keeping a business afloat.“Most of the time they’re New Yorkers looking to meet us halfway,” he said. “We’re going to survive it.”Moments later, three patrons appeared, and Mr. Geer jumped up to greet them with a grin.Sean Piccoli and Téa Kvetenadze contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Pompidou Center, Aging Symbol of the Future, to Close for Renovations</title>
	<author>Sarah Bahr</author>
	<body>The Pompidou Center, whose daring, inside-out architecture and modern art museum have made it one of Paris’s premier cultural attractions, will close for renovations from late 2023 until some time in 2027, France’s culture minister said on Monday.The center, which opened in 1977, is notable for the way its architects, Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, moved many of the building’s structural and mechanical elements to its exterior, which is veined with color-coded water pipes, air-conditioning ducts and a caterpillar-like escalator snaking up its facade.But it has had physical problems before — it was closed in 1997 for renovations that took a couple of years — and lately has been showing signs of aging again. Roselyne Bachelot, France’s culture minister, told the newspaper Le Figaro that she had been faced with two options: trying to keep the Pompidou Center open during the work, which would then take longer, or allowing it to be closed completely for the duration.“I chose the second because it should be shorter and a little bit less expensive,” she said.Officials now said that many components of the building, which was once seen as a jolt of shocking modernity in the stately heart of Paris, are at the end of their useful lives — including an antiquated heating and cooling system, escalators and elevators that break down, and asbestos that must be removed — Le Figaro reported. The newspaper reported that the renovations could cost €200 million, or about $243 million.The center had warned in September that it was facing either a full closure for three years, beginning in 2023, or a partial closure for seven years, to allow for repairs.The last time the building closed for renovations was during its 20th anniversary year in 1997, when it closed for a three-year renovation that increased the exhibition space available inside. But no major work has been done on the building since it opened in 1977, the Pompidou Center’s president, Serge Lasvignes, told Le Figaro in September.Though the building is now widely beloved, it was met with shock and criticism when it was being built and when it first opened. Piano later chuckled that he and Rogers had been “young boys, really young and quite bad boys” in 1971 when they won the competition to design it. Rogers later recalled that a passer-by hit him with an umbrella upon learning he was one of its designers.In addition to the art museum, the building contains a sprawling public library and a center for music and acoustic research.A quarter of a century ago, as the center prepared to close for those major renovations, the need for repairs sparked unflattering remarks about the quality of modern architecture and engineering in a city full of churches, palaces and museums dating back hundreds of years. French officials said at the time that the center had become a victim of its own success, attracting far more visitors than it was designed for.Soon after the Pompidou Center reopened from those renovations, in 2000, Piano suggested to The New York Times, only half-jokingly, that the center close every 25 years so its function could be rethought. It turns out he was not far off.</body>

	<title>مصر أنكرت أن انقطاع الأكسجين تسبب في موت مرضى كوفيد، لكن صحيفة النيو يورك تايمز اكتشفت خلاف ذلك.</title>
	<author>Yousur Al-Hlou</author>
	<body>الحسينية، مصر – من شرفة أحد المستشفيات المصرية، شقّت صرخة إحدى الممرضات سكون الليل لتعلن أن مرضى كوفيد في غرفة العناية المركزة يلفظون أنفاسهم الأخيرة.‎أحمد نافع، الذي كان يقف خارج المبنى، اندفع بسرعة متجاوزًا حارس الأمن إلى غرفة العناية المركزة ليجد عمّته التي تبلغ من العمر 62 عامًا قد فارقت الحياة.وسط مشاعر الغضب، أخرج نافع هاتفه المحمول وبدأ بالتصوير. بدا أن إمدادات الأكسجين في المستشفى قد نفدت. وكانت شاشات المراقبة تطلق صفيرها، وممرضة تبدو عليها علامات الصدمة قد انزوت في أحد أركان الغرفة، بينما يحاول الآخرون إنعاش مريض باستخدام جهاز تنفس يدوي.أربعة مرضى على الأقل فارقوا الحياة..انتشر مقطع الفيديو الذي التقطه نافع، ومدّته 47 ثانية، انتشارًا واسعاً على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي الشهر الجاري، وفيه تظهر الفوضى في مستشفى الحسينية المركزي، على بعد ساعتين ونصف شمال شرق القاهرة.ومع تزايد حدّة الغضب نفت الحكومة المصرية نفاد الأكسجين من المستشفى.فقد ذكر تصريح رسمي، صدر في اليوم التالي للواقعة، أن المرضى الأربعة كانوا يعانون من “مضاعفات” وأن وفاتهم لم تكن لها “ علاقة” بنقص الأكسجين. قامت النيابة باستجواب نافع، وألقى المسؤولون باللوم عليه لانتهاكه القواعد التي تمنع الزيارات والتصوير داخل المستشفيات.لكن التحقيق الذي أجرته صحيفة النيويورك تايمز كشف شيئًا آخر.ذكر شهود عيان، من بينهم أفراد الطاقم الطبي وأقارب المرضى، في لقاءات أجريناها معهم، أن ضغط الأكسجين قد انخفض إلى مستويات متدنية جدًا، وأن ثلاثة مرضى على الأقل، وربما أربعة، قد ماتوا بسبب نقص الأكسجين. يُذكر أيضًا أن عدة أطباء في كل من مصر والولايات المتحدة قد أجروا تحليلًا دقيقًا للمقطع المصوّر وأكدوا أن حالة الفوضى التي عمّت غرفة العناية المركزة إنما تشير إلى تقطع في إمداد الأكسجين.وتبين أن نقص الأكسجين الذي أودى بحياة المرضى كان نتيجة لسلسلة من المشاكل التي يعاني منها المستشفى. فبينما كان المرضى يتعرضون للاختناق في غرفة العناية المركزة، كان هناك تأخيرٌ لمدة ساعات على وصول شحنة أكسجين تم طلبها في وقت سابق، ولم تنجح أيضا محاولات استخدام الأكسجين الاحتياطي.قال أحد الأطباء بالمستشفى، الذي رفض الكشف عن هويته خشية التعرّض للاعتقال: “لن ندفن رؤوسنا في الرمال ونتظاهر بأن كل شيء على ما يرام. يمكن للعالم أجمع أن يقرّ بأن لديهم مشاكل؛ أما نحن فلا.”لم يكن اندفاع الحكومة إلى إنكار الواقعة إلا مثالا آخر على غياب الشفافية بشأن استجابتها لأزمة كوفيد، وهو ما أسفر عن انتشار حالة من الارتياب في التصريحات العامة.رأى كثيرٌ من المصريين في المقطع الذي صوّره نافع مشهدا نادرًا وغير مألوف للخسائر الفعلية التي خلّفها فيروس كورونا وسط ذروة الموجة الثانية من الجائحة في مصر.أقرّت الحكومة المصرية بوفاة أربعة أشخاص في غرفة العناية المركزة يوم الثاني من يناير، لكنها نفت أن تكون وفاتهم بسبب نقص الأكسجين.ذكرت وزارة الصحّة في تصريح رسمي أن حالات الوفاة كانت لمرضى أغلبهم من كبار السن، وأنها وقعت في فترات زمنية مختلفة، وأن مرضى آخرين، من بينهم أطفال حديثو الولادة في قسم الحضانات، كانوا يحصلون على الأكسجين من نفس الشبكة ولم يتأثر أحدٌ منهم. وأضافت الوزارة أن هذه المعطيات تؤكد “عدم وجود علاقة بين حالات الوفاة وما يثار عن حدوث نقص في الأكسجين بالمستشفى”.أكّد أفراد بالطاقم الطبي أن الأكسجين في المستشفى لم ينفد تمامًا، لكنّ الضغط أصبح منخفضًا بدرجة خطيرة. وأضافوا أن الوضع كان أسوأ في غرفة العناية المركزة وأن ضغط الأكسجين لم يكن كافيًا للحفاظ على حياة المرضى. كما أوضحوا أن المنافذ التي تجلب الأكسجين إلى غرفة العناية المركزة ربما كانت في نهاية الشبكة أو ربما كانت هناك مشاكل أخرى في خط الإمداد.لم تنجح محاولات العاملين في المستشفى لإنقاذ الموقف بسبب وجود مشاكل أخرى. فعندما حاولوا تحويل إمداد الأكسجين في غرفة العناية المركزة من خزان المستشفى الرئيسي إلى المخزون الاحتياطي، بدا أن هناك زيادة في العبء على النظام البديل ولم يعمل.وفي وقت سابق من نفس اليوم، عندما أدرك مسؤولو المستشفى انخفاض مستوى الأكسجين، طلبوا من وزارة الصحة تزويد المستشفى بالمزيد. لكن شاحنة التوصيل التي كان مقررا لها أن تصل بعد ظهر ذلك اليوم تأخّرت أكثر من ثلاث ساعات عن موعدها.يقول طبيب المستشفى: “لو كانت الشاحنة قد وصلت قبل السادسة مساءً لما حدث أيٌّ من ذلك.”رصد الخبراء الطبيون الذين حلّلوا المقطع المصوّر، ومنهم ستة أطباء في الولايات المتحدة و مصر، بعض التفاصيل التي تدعم رواية انقطاع الأكسجين.لم يظهر أي مريض في مقطع الفيديو متصلًا بخط الأكسجين الرئيسي.وبيّن المقطع أحد الأطباء وهو يستخدم أسطوانة أكسجين محمولة، كالتي  تُستخدم عادة في حالات الطوارئ. وعلى بعد بضعة أمتار، كانت مجموعة من الممرضات يحاولن إنعاش مريض باستخدام وسادة هوائية يدوية لا يبدو أنها متصلة بأي مصدر للأكسجين.يقول الدكتور هشام النشواتي، وهو طبيب عناية عاجلة في نيويورك كان سابقا يعمل في وحدات العناية المركزة: “لا يوجد أنبوب أكسجين متصل بالوسادة الهوائية، ما يعني أن المريض يُزوّد بهواء عادي، وهو أمر لا يحدث عادةً. بل من المستحيل أن يحدث إلا في غياب الأكسجين.”أما الدكتور بشرى مينا، المصري الأمريكي ورئيس قسم طب الرئة في مستشفى لينوكس هيل، والذي عالج مئات المصابين بكوفيد – 19 في نيويورك، فقد لاحظ “العجلة الشديدة” التي كان يحاول بها الطبيب وطاقم التمريض في الفيديو “الحصول على أكسجين الطوارئ أو أكسجين إضافي للمرضى.”وقال الدكتور مينا: “يمكن لوضع كهذا أن يكون مربكًا حتى في الولايات المتحدة بكلّ ما لديها من موارد. فما بالك بهذا الوضع في مصر، حيث الموارد محدودة والكل يعمل فوق طاقته.”أزمة نقص الأكسجين في مستشفى الحسينية المركزي قد لا تكون الوحيدة من نوعها.فقد امتلأت وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي بما يشير الى تكرار أزمة نقص الأكسجين في مستشفيات أخرى لمدة أسبوع كامل. وقد أطلق مدير أحد المستشفيات استغاثة على أحد مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي دعا فيها الناس إلى التبرع بأسطوانات الأكسجين بسبب “احتياج ضروري” إليها. كما نشر مريض في مستشفى آخر مقطعًا مصوّرًا التقطه لنفسه داخل ردهة العزل وهو يقول: “لا يوجد لدينا ما يكفي من الأكسجين”. وانتشر كذلك مقطع فيديو شبيه بالمقطع الذي صوره نافع على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي.لم نتمكن من التحقق بصورة مستقلة من صحّة هذه الإدعاءات.وتساءل أيمن سبع، الباحث في المبادرة المصرية للحقوق الشخصية: “هل توجد فعلا مشكلة؟” واستطرد قائلا: “لا يمكن لأحد أن يقول أن لديه هذه المعلومات باستثناء الحكومة.”ولكن أداء الحكومة المصرية خلال الأزمة لم يولد الثقة لدى المصريين .فقد وصف الرئيس عبد الفتاح السيسي من ينتقدون جهود الحكومة المصرية في التصدي لأزمة كورونا بأنهم “أعداء الدولة”. وقامت الجهات الأمنية بطرد صحفية أجنبية شككت في الأرقام المعلنة للإصابات؛ كما توعّد النائب العام أي شخص ينشر “أخبارًا كاذبة” حول فيروس كورونا بعقوبة السجن لمدة تصل إلى خمس سنوات.و دخلت الحكومة في حالة عداء شديد مع الأطباء الذين احتجّوا في الأشهر الأولى من الجائحة بسبب نقص أدوات الحماية الوقائية، وجرى اعتقال عدد من الأطباء.يقول السباعي: “إنهم يحاولون فرض روايتهم بأن الأوضاع تحت السيطرة. ومن وسائل تحقيق ذلك التحكم في المعلومات التي تصل إلى العامة. ليست لديّ مشكلة في ذلك لو أن المعلومات التي تصلنا تكون ذات مصداقية يمكننا أن نعوّل عليها.”ولكن عندما ظهر فيديو مستشفى الحسينية المركزي وصل الأمر بالمسؤولين إلى حدّ إخبار الناس بأن ما يرونه ليس صحيحا.قال ممدوح غراب، محافظ الشرقية التي يقع فيها مستشفى الحسينية المركزي: “هذا المشهد مش مشهد انقطاع أكسجين.” جاء ذلك ضمن مداخلة مع برنامج تلفزيوني؛ ولم يقدم البرنامج أي مقابلة ولم يستضف أي شهود للرد على الرواية الرسمية.حتى الأرقام الرسمية يبدو أنها لا تعبر عن الواقع. فقد أعلنت مصر عن أكثر من 150 ألف حالة إصابة بمرض كوفيد – 19 وأكثر من 8000 حالة وفاة، وهي أرقام منخفضة للغاية مقارنة بسائر دول المنطقة وبالنظر إلى تعداد السكان الذي يزيد على 100 مليون نسمة.لكن بعض الخبراء، بل وبعض المسؤولين، يرون أن الأرقام المعلنة للإصابات والوفيات أقلّ بكثير من الأرقام الفعلية بسبب النقص في إجراء الفحوصات على نطاق واسع، ولأن المختبرات التي تجري الفحوصات لا تبلّغ الحكومة  دائما بالنتائج.وعلى الرغم من نفي الحكومة واقعة نقص الأكسجين في مستشفى الحسينية المركزي، بدأ المسؤولون باتخاذ إجراءات لحلّ المشكلة، وكأن ذلك إقرار ضمنيًّ بوجودها.فقد أقرت وزيرة الصحة هالة زايد بوجود نقص في شاحنات توصيل الأكسجين وتأخير في عملية التوزيع. كما أن الرئيس السيسي طالب الحكومة بمضاعفة إنتاج الأكسجين لتلبية الارتفاع الشديد في الطلب.واتخذت الحكومة  إجراء آخر بمنع الزائرين من اصطحاب هواتفهم المحمولة إلى داخل المستشفى.أعدّت التقرير منى النجار من الحسينية، ويسر الحلو من نيويورك. الفيديو: آرييل راي وبن لافين.</body>

	<title>Unions May Complicate Biden’s School Plans</title>
	<author>Adam Pasick</author>
	<body>This is the Coronavirus Schools Briefing, a guide to the seismic changes in U.S. education that are taking place during the pandemic. Sign up here to get this newsletter in your inbox.The Chicago Teachers Union said on Sunday that a majority of its members had voted to authorize a strike if the nation’s third-largest school district sought to force teachers back into school buildings.Chicago Public Schools said it would delay the teachers’ return, originally scheduled for today, by two days for “ongoing” discussions. Students are still due back on Feb. 1.Teachers unions are flexing their muscles nationwide. This weekend in Montclair, N.J., an affluent suburb of New York City, the union also delayed a planned reopening of schools. And in Bellevue, Wash., district officials sought an injunction against the union after teachers, concerned about safety, refused to participate in in-person instruction.These actions may complicate President Biden’s plan to reopen schools in his first 100 days in office. He has vowed to throw the strength of the federal government behind an effort to “reopen school doors as quickly as possible.” But our colleague Dana Goldstein reports that the return to normality may be anything but speedy.About half of American students are still learning virtually. Teachers are uncertain about when they will be vaccinated, and their unions are fighting efforts to return their members to crowded hallways. But some school administrators, mayors and parents feel increased urgency to get children back into classrooms, especially those who are struggling academically and emotionally.Biden has ordered federal agencies to create national school reopening guidelines, and support virus tracing and data collection. The White House is also pushing a stimulus package that would provide $130 billion to schools for costs such as virus testing, upgrading ventilation systems and hiring staff.But teachers and unions are still leery, and administrators have begun to say what was previously unthinkable: that schools may not operate normally for the 2021-22 school year. Labor leaders are seeking to tamp down Biden’s expectations, and seek measures that would address teachers’ anxiety about in-person school.Biden’s pledge is “an arbitrary and a political statement, not a pedagogical statement or a science or health statement,” said Kenzo Shibata, a high school teacher and official with the Chicago Teachers Union. “It doesn’t inspire a lot of faith in me.”Since school buildings in and around Las Vegas closed in March, 18 students have died by suicide, compared with nine last year, according to Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent. Now, the district, the nation’s fifth largest, is scrambling to bring children back to classrooms.“This story isn’t about the ‘pro-reopening’ movement,” tweeted Erica Green, our colleague who covers education policy for The Times. “This story isn’t about ‘anti-union’ sentiment. This story is about how the pandemic has tested the resilience of this generation’s children like never before.”This month, the Clark County school board gave the green light to phase in the return of some elementary school grades and groups of struggling students, even as greater Las Vegas continues to post huge numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths.Adolescent suicide during the pandemic cannot conclusively be linked to school closures. National data on suicides in 2020 have yet to be compiled and, even in normal circumstances, suicides are impulsive, unpredictable and difficult to ascribe to specific causes.But the pandemic has created conditions unlike anything mental health professionals have seen before, making causation that much more difficult to determine. The parents of a 14-year-old boy in Maryland who killed himself in October described how their son “gave up” after his district decided not to return in the fall. In December, an 11-year-old boy in Sacramento shot himself during his Zoom class. And the father of a teenager in Maine attributed his son’s suicide to the isolation of the pandemic.Schools “are the nexus of adolescent life,” said Suzie Button, the senior clinical director for high school programming at the Jed Foundation, a nonprofit based in New York that works on suicide prevention.“And in times like this, young people are sometimes the canaries in the coal mine.”If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK). You can find a list of additional resources at SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources.The University of Michigan paused “athletic activities in all sports” — games and training sessions alike — after several people in the department tested positive for the new coronavirus variant.Dickinson College is splitting its semester: First year students and sophomores are on campus right now; juniors and seniors will switch in halfway through to finish.First year students at the University of Pennsylvania are reportedly partying in violation of coronavirus guidelines, Abi Murugadoss reported for The Daily Pennsylvanian, the student paper.Applications to Harvard surged by 42 percent to more than 57,000. The dean of admissions attributed the influx to generous financial aid, online recruiting and optional standardized tests.Students will not return to campus at Harvey Mudd College this spring.Rutgers University will not require students to be vaccinated to return to campus in the fall.A good read: College students in France are suffering, as financial distress exacerbates mental health challenges. Through a coordinated effort, they’ve pushed their struggle to the top of the national agenda, The Washington Post reports.Fans can attend high school sports games in Idaho under state orders that allow gyms to function at 40 percent capacity. But unmasked spectators have been seen sitting close together in the bleachers, The Idaho Statesman reported.In Texas, some teachers are prioritizing basic skills during the pandemic. Bekah McNeel, a correspondent at The 74, described it as “a surgical approach to keep young students at grade level, focusing on a core curriculum of must-have skills in reading and math.”Fourth and fifth graders in Denver are back in classrooms after mostly learning remotely since March. “I was nervous at first, but then I saw they were doing it carefully and I felt really excited because I get to see all of my friends,” Kennedy Fox, a fourth grader, told Chalkbeat Colorado.A teacher remembered: Matthew Beaver, 40, was a middle school physical education teacher and coach in North Carolina. He died after contracting the coronavirus, and had been teaching in person. “He affected so many people in a positive manner,” a colleague said. “Made me a better teacher.” A defiant school board: Patrick Key, a 53-year-old teacher in Cobb County, Ga., died on Christmas after contracting Covid-19. During a moment of silence, at least two members of his school board refused to wear masks in his honor.A good read: For months, early childhood educators have been hailed as heroes. But unlike teachers, who often belong to powerful unions, they may not get priority for vaccines, EdSurge reports.Money has been tight for many families during the pandemic, and it can be expensive to buy produce. But most teenagers in the United States do not eat enough fruits and vegetables, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our colleague Christina Caron offered some tips and suggestions for thinking through a diet change.Kate Taylor contributed reporting.Sign up here to get the briefing by email.</body>

	<title>James R. Flynn, Who Found We Are Getting Smarter, Dies at 86</title>
	<author>Clay Risen</author>
	<body>In 1978, James R. Flynn, a political philosopher at the University of Otago, in New Zealand, was writing a book about what constituted a “humane” society. He considered “inhumane” societies as well — dictatorships, apartheid states — and, in his reading, came across the work of Arthur R. Jensen, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley.Dr. Jensen was best known for an article he published in 1969 claiming that the differences between Black and white Americans on I.Q. tests resulted from genetic differences between the races — and that programs that tried to improve Black educational outcomes, like Head Start, were bound to fail.Dr. Flynn, a committed leftist who had once been a civil rights organizer in Kentucky, felt instinctively that Dr. Jensen was wrong, and he set out to prove it. In 1980 he published a thorough, devastating critique of Dr. Jensen’s work — showing, for example, that many groups of whites scored as low on I.Q. tests as Black Americans. But he didn’t stop there.Like most researchers in his field, Dr. Jensen had assumed that intelligence was constant across generations, pointing to the relative stability of I.Q. tests over time as evidence. But Dr. Flynn noticed something that no one else had: Those tests were recalibrated every decade or so. When he looked at the raw, uncalibrated data over nearly 100 years, he found that I.Q. scores had gone up, dramatically.“If you scored people 100 years ago against our norms, they would score a 70,” or borderline mentally disabled, he said later. “If you scored us against their norms, we would score 130” — borderline gifted.Just as groundbreaking was his explanation for why. The rise was too fast to be genetic, nor could it be that our recent ancestors were less intelligent than we are. Rather, he argued, the last century has seen a revolution in abstract thinking, what he called “scientific spectacles,” brought on by the demands of a technologically robust industrial society. This new order, he maintained, required greater educational attainment and an ability to think in terms of symbols, analogies and complex logic — exactly what many I.Q. tests measure.“He surprised everyone, despite the fact that the field of intelligence research is intensely data-centric,” the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker said in an interview. “This philosopher discovered a major phenomenon that everyone had missed.”Though Dr. Flynn published his research in 1984, it was not until a decade later that it drew attention outside the narrow world of intelligence researchers.The turning point came with the publication in 1994 of “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,” by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles A. Murray, which argued that genes play a dominant role in shaping intelligence — a position that its fiercest critics called racist. In reviewing arguments for and against their position, the authors outlined Dr. Flynn’s research and even gave it a name: the Flynn effect.A buzzword was born. The Flynn effect became shorthand for an optimistic view of the human condition and made Dr. Flynn something of a pop-culture hero, an image underscored by his lanky build, rumpled outfits and Einsteinian mess of curly white hair. A 2013 TED Talk in which he explained “why our I.Q. levels are higher than our grandparents’” has been viewed 4.4 million times.Dr. Flynn died at 86 on Dec. 11 at an assisted living center in Dunedin, New Zealand. The cause was intestinal cancer, said his son, Victor Flynn, a math professor at Oxford.In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Emily (Malkin) Flynn, a divorce lawyer, and his daughter, Natalie Flynn, a clinical psychologist.Dr. Flynn and Dr. Murray became frequent debating partners, especially after Dr. Flynn showed in subsequent research, with William T. Dickens, that the Black-white I.Q. gap had diminished significantly between 1972 and 2002.But while they differed intellectually, Dr. Flynn was also quick to defend Dr. Murray — and Dr. Jensen, for that matter — against the accusations of racism. He dedicated one of his books to Dr. Jensen, and he took Dr. Murray’s side in 2017 after students at Middlebury College in Vermont shut down a speech by Dr. Murray.“Jim was a paragon of intellectual curiosity and willingness to look at all the evidence,” Dr. Murray said in an interview. “He had almost a childlike curiosity, and I mean that in a good way.”James Robert Flynn was born on April 28, 1934, in Washington, to Joseph and Mae Flynn. His father was a journalist, and his mother was a homemaker.Raised a Roman Catholic, he renounced religion when he was 12. As a scholarship student at the University of Chicago, he had originally planned to study mathematics or physics, but he was nagged by the question of how morality functions without faith. Having completed all his core requirements in his freshman year, he dived into political philosophy. He received his doctorate in 1958, when he was just 24.Already a man of the left — Dr. Flynn joined the Socialist Party in college — Dr. Flynn became involved in the civil rights movement after graduating. He met Emily Malkin at a protest against a segregated amusement park in the Washington suburbs, and they named their first child after Dr. Flynn’s hero, the American socialist Eugene Victor Debs.He continued his activism as a professor at what is now Eastern Kentucky University, in the town of Richmond, about 30 miles south of Lexington. There he helped organize against the city’s segregated downtown businesses, drawing threats from the mayor and a reprimand from the college president. A lifelong competitive runner, he was removed as the track coach.He left in 1961 for a job at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, then another at Lake Forest College, outside Chicago. But he came to believe that his left-wing politics had foreclosed the possibility of an academic career in the United States. He looked abroad, and in 1963 he landed a job at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Four years later he moved to the University of Otago, in Dunedin, where he remained until his retirement in 2020.Though Dr. Flynn was based in the university’s political studies department, his writings and interests ranged widely. In between books on liberalism, world history and political censorship, he advised Australia’s prime minister on foreign policy, organized against the war in Vietnam and, in the 1990s, founded two left-wing political parties. He ran unsuccessfully for Parliament three times.Though he was widely recognized for making one of the most significant psychological discoveries of the late 20th century, Dr. Flynn was modest about his contributions, as well as his standing in his adopted field. He had, he said, merely taken a “holiday” in psychology, then stuck around out of a sense of obligation to clean up the “mess” he had made.He was always careful to qualify his claims: Despite his success in overturning the notion that genes are everything, he never dismissed it entirely. Genes played a large part in determining intelligence, he maintained, especially at the individual level, but so did environment and what he called “chance factors,” like accidents and life decisions — in other words, free will. And environment made all the difference in explaining the gaps between different groups within a society, whether racial, gender, class or otherwise.He was also aware of the uncomfortable implications of his position: that by ascribing differences between Black and white I.Q. tests to environment, he was running the risk of blaming Black parenting and culture.“You’re caught between the devil and the deep blue sea,” he said in an interview with Skeptic magazine. “Either you say it’s genetic or you say there is something about Black child-rearing practices that don’t provide cognitive challenge, in which case you’re blaming the victim.”Unlike many academics, Dr. Flynn increased his output as he aged: Eleven of his 18 books appeared in his last decade, many of them going back to his earlier interests in political theory and free speech. He became increasingly focused on academic freedom and a critic of so-called cancel culture, especially on campus.His last book, “In Defense of Free Speech: The University as Censor,” was rejected by its first publisher as incendiary — though, as Dr. Flynn pointed out, he was merely summarizing the positions of people he disagreed with, in order to make a larger point. Frustrated, he found a new publisher for the book, which he retitled “A Book Too Risky to Publish: Free Speech and Universities” (2019).“Dad was always very respectful of people he disagreed with, and hated the trend of boycotting academics because of their views,” Professor Flynn, his son, said. “He very much thought that people should be able to express their views, and if you don’t agree, argue with them.”</body>

	<title>Doctors, Facing Burnout, Turn to Self-Care</title>
	<author>Abby Ellin</author>
	<body>Dr. Michelle Thompson knows a lot about self-care. A family medicine physician in Vienna, Ohio, she specializes in lifestyle and integrative care, using both conventional and alternative therapies to help her patients heal. She also teaches medical personnel how to prevent and treat burnout.But despite what she recommends to others, taking care of her own emotional well-being hasn’t been easy during the pandemic.When the pandemic hit in March, Dr. Thompson, 46, who is also chair of medicine for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Horizon regional health service, was seeing about 25 patients a day in her office, whom she had to convert to seeing via telemedicine “overnight,” she said. In April, she joined an eight-week online mind-body skills program run by Dr. James S. Gordon, founder and executive director of The Center for Mind-Body Medicine, which since its founding in 1991 has trained nearly a thousand health care professionals in various self-care measures that they can use in their practices. Dr. Gordon, a psychiatrist, started the skills group earlier this year to help doctors and other health care workers cope with the extra demands and psychological suffering the pandemic has brought. The program included weekly Zoom calls with others on the front lines, along with meditative exercises like drawing pictures, visualizations and guided imagery.“It allowed me two hours a week to check in with myself and share my experience with other health care professionals who could relate to the overwhelm and intensity of the pandemic,” Dr. Thompson said. “I never realized the power of group support.”Physician burnout has long been a serious concern in the medical community, with roughly 400 doctors dying by suicide each year in the United States. The issue of pandemic burnout among physicians came to the forefront in the early months of the pandemic following the death of Dr. Lorna M. Breen, who supervised the emergency department at New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital in Manhattan. Dr. Breen, who had been sick with Covid but working remotely, was later admitted to a psychiatric ward for 10 days. Fearing the professional repercussions of her mental health treatment, she took her own life in April.“She was overwhelmed with the volume of death and dying, and she could not keep up,” said her brother-in-law, Corey Feist, a lawyer in Charlottesville, Va. “The industry needs a big cultural change.”Mr. Feist and his wife, Jennifer Feist, Dr. Breen’s sister, have since co-founded the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes’ Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the emotional well-being of health care workers. The Feists also worked with politicians and a cross section of health care industry experts to develop the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which aims to reduce and prevent burnout, mental and behavioral health conditions and suicide among health care professionals.An October poll of 862 emergency physicians nationwide from the American College of Emergency Physicians and Morning Consult found that 87 percent felt more stressed since the onset of Covid-19, with 72 percent experiencing a greater degree of professional burnout. Concerns about family, friends and their own health were among their chief concerns, along with financial and job security and a lack of personal protective equipment. Yet consistent with a longstanding stigma surrounding physician mental health, 45 percent weren’t comfortable seeking mental health treatment, citing concerns about workplace stigma and fear of professional reprisal.The American Psychiatric Association, the American Medical Association and other professional groups, have formal statements against punishing doctors who seek mental health treatment. The Americans With Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination based on disability, including psychiatric disability, applies to professional licensing bodies. Still, the stigma persists.A growing number of organizations and programs have taken up the charge to help doctors, nurses, residents, interns and medical students who are struggling with mental health issues.Columbia University, for example, created CopeColumbia for employees of Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Another program called #FirstRespondersFirst, from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Thrive Global, and the CAA Foundation, recently unveiled its new mental health initiative, designed to provide support to health care workers in the United States and abroad. The Frontline Workers Counseling Project includes some 500 volunteer therapists in the San Francisco Bay Area, while the Physician Support Line, started in late March, is a free, national support line of some 700 volunteer psychiatrists who provide peer support.“Part of the healing for me is helping other people,” said Dr. Lois Kroplick, a psychiatrist in private practice in Pomona, N.Y., who co-ran a weekly support group for psychiatrists and psychologists at Garnet Health Medical Center, in Middletown, N.Y., and volunteered with the Physician Support Line. During this same period, Dr. Kroplick lost her first grandchild and mother-in-law. “The best way to cope with my own grief was to help others,” she said.Doctors recognize the growing need for mental health help for others, and for themselves. And as the infection rate continues to climb, many health care workers feel torn between their duty to help patients while also caring for themselves.Elizabeth M. Goldberg is an associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University, in Providence, and an emergency room physician. “In March and April there was this sense that you choose either your patients or yourself and it was your expectation to be there,” said Dr. Goldberg, 38, who has three young children. “Many of us wanted to be there, but I did experience fear and anxiety about going to work.”She attended a free support group for health care workers, which she had never done before. “It was great hearing other people share similar experiences I had of not sleeping well and worrying about our family’s health and talking openly about our anxiety and fear of contracting the illness,” she said.Kathleen S. Isaac, 32, clinical assistant professor at NYU Langone Health who is also in private practice in New York, created a weekly support group in June for her residents. But not many doctors showed up. Part of that she attributes to time constraints and demanding schedules, but also that many were simply trying to be stoic and power through.“Asking for help is less stigmatized in the psychological community, but sometimes I think there’s a sense of ‘I’m fine, I know what I’m doing,’” she said. “There’s such a culture of perfectionism, and it’s so competitive that people want to present their best self. It’s harder to admit they’re struggling.”This applies in her own life, too. She talks to friends and colleagues, exercises, goes to therapy and admits to binge-watching the sitcom “That’s So Raven” to help her unwind.As for Dr. Thompson, she credits the Body Mind Skills group with helping her change her own self-care routine, checking in with herself hourly. “I ask myself, ‘What do I need? How am I caring for myself in this moment? Do I need a cup of tea? Should I implement some mind-body medicine?’” she said.This might include soft belly breathing, dancing, mindful eating or just heading outside to get a breath of fresh air. “Maybe I just need to use the restroom and need to make time for simple basic self-care needs,” she said.“This has been the hardest time of my life, and I am super grounded and really well balanced,” she added. “I am doing OK, but it is constant work and making sure I’m staying aware of my own self.”</body>

	<title>The Talk of the Super Bowl Is Quarterbacks, Except One</title>
	<author>Kurt Streeter</author>
	<body>Kap was right.Let’s not forget that.Let’s not erase his legacy the way the powers running the N.F.L. would like.As we barrel full steam toward the Super Bowl on Feb. 7, let’s not lose sight of the fact that Colin Kaepernick’s protest — his willingness to oppose the status quo and challenge America’s racial caste system — carried the profound weight of truth.Fans should remember. Team owners and the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, should remember.What about the players? Since many of them have dropped their guard and allowed the message to be watered down, they need to remember too.The big game is less than two weeks away, with the Kansas City Chiefs seeking to successfully defend their title against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The narrative will center on quarterbacks, and rightly so. Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes aren’t just among the greatest to ever play, they are among the most captivating.But years from now, when historians assess the connection between professional sports and the state of the world in the current era, which N.F.L. quarterback will loom largest?I’ll bet on Kaepernick, once among the league’s most electric players, censured and shut out of the game since 2016. Kaepernick, whose kneeling protest during the national anthem tore at the heart of the one sport that most embodies America and its myths.Kaepernick, loved and loathed, celebrated as a champion for justice and denounced by politicians looking to hype racial resentment, no matter the costs.He has not just been at the center of the storm. At times he has been the storm. All of the other quarterbacks are throwing their beautiful spirals while watching safely from afar — careers well intact.We’ve just endured a presidential term of brazen demagogy from a man many N.F.L. owners have considered a great leader and friend. We’ve seen the rise of white supremacy. The stream of police shootings. The killing of George Floyd. Protests, the coronavirus pandemic and the deadly storming of the Capitol.Kaepernick’s critique of America foretold it all.But if you think everything is fine now that there’s a new face in the White House, think again. Remember that he began his protest not under former President Donald J. Trump, but in the waning days of the Obama administration. He knelt not just against the cracking structure of modern day racism, but its faulty foundation, laid down centuries ago and built upon ever since.His shadow still hangs over a league that heads to the Super Bowl acting as if he has never existed. N.F.L. owners — and their chief spokesman, Goodell — would rather slice him from collective memory and move on.“There is nothing more humbling for the billionaires who own N.F.L. teams than to be proven wrong, especially by a Black athlete who is seen as a thorn in their side,” Derrick White, a professor of African-American studies at the University of Kentucky and an expert on race and football, said when we spoke last week.That’s why the league settled the union grievance filed by the former 49ers quarterback and his former teammate Eric Reid. The pair claimed they were blackballed by the N.F.L. for protesting. A multimillion-dollar payout, replete with a confidentiality agreement, was easier to swallow than giving Kaepernick more airtime.After Floyd’s killing and protests against police brutality intensified around the world, Goodell was forced to admit the league had been wrong not to listen to players who had been speaking out against systemic racism for years. He summoned the courage to utter the phrase “Black Lives Matter.” And he carefully avoided mention of Kaepernick.The N.F.L. soon began co-opting the message. Sadly enough, the players have largely gone along with the plan. Kneeling protests waned to a trickle. The riot in Washington seemed to offer a prime opportunity for clamoring, unified protest. It didn’t happen. There were games to be played. Money to be made. Jobs to hold on to. And nobody with Kaepernick’s spine.You have to hand it to the czars of football. They’ve neutralized the message. They made just enough room for the previously unthinkable in a sport so conservative, so connected to the police and the military and the flag. Think of the helmets with the social justice messaging and the names of victims of police shootings, and the pithy phrases painted on the edge of fields.One such phrase: “It Takes All of Us.”Well, all of us clearly does not include Kaepernick. As much as he would like to, he will never play again. This season of chaos, when he wasn’t called upon even as teams were steadily depleted by the virus, put an end to any such hope.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Another new motto: “End Racism.”This from a league with a long, sordid history of discrimination. A league known to prize Black speed and strength while diminishing Black intelligence and leadership.N.F.L. rosters are 70 percent African-American. There are only two Black head coaches. The league used to tell African-Americans they would get lead jobs if they just put in more patient years learning the craft. Done. Then came an all-too-familiar course correction: The series of recently hired white coaches who are heralded for their genius despite their glaring inexperience.End Racism? Stop with the Orwellian hypocrisy.What if the league had not turned its back on Kaepernick? What if, from the start, it had listened to him and started a sincere dialogue with Black players who emulated his protest?How soon we forget his magnetic talent, lost in the passage of time and obscured by silly arguments that focus on his last struggling seasons leading a 49ers team with little talent and lackluster coaching.To remember his potential, check out the YouTube highlights.Watch his four touchdowns on the frigid New England night in 2012, when he dueled Brady’s Patriots and led the 49ers to a 41-34 win. Skip next to his playoff game in 2013 against Green Bay, when he rushed for 181 yards and outpassed Aaron Rodgers.What might have been is part of the tragedy now. To flourish, the N.F.L. needs singular stars. If Kaepernick had not been rooted from the league, maybe he’s one of the quarterbacks guiding a team to the Super Bowl. Maybe he’s even the talk of it.Of course, you aren’t likely to hear from Kaepernick as we approach the big game. Silence has become his mystique, which fuels an enduring power.So who will do it? Who will bring him up, give him his due and keep telling the story? Who will keep the movement front and center, raw and real, instead of the stuff of manicured public-relations campaigns?What a shame that this is an open question, since there is still so much work to be done.What a shame, because “Kap was right” is not hard to say.</body>

	<title>25 Great Writers and Thinkers Weigh In on Books That Matter</title>
	<author>John Williams</author>
	<body>On Oct. 10, 1896, after years of robust literary coverage at The New York Times, the paper published the first issue of the Book Review.In the 125 years since, that coverage has broadened and deepened. The Book Review has become a lens through which to view not just literature but the world at large, with scholars and thinkers weighing in on all of the people and issues and subjects covered in books on philosophy, art, science, economics, history and more.In many ways, the Book Review’s history is that of American letters, and we’ll be using our 125th anniversary this year to celebrate and examine that history over the coming months. In essays, photo stories, timelines and other formats, we’ll highlight the books and authors that made it all possible.Because, really, writers are at the heart of everything we do. Pairing a book with the right reviewer is a challenge, one that we relish. And we’ve been fortunate to feature the writing of so many illustrious figures in our pages — novelists, musicians, presidents, Nobel winners, CEOs, poets, playwrights — all offering their insights with wit and flair. Here are 25 of them.H.G. Wells | Vladimir Nabokov | Tennessee Williams | Patricia Highsmith | Shirley Jackson | Eudora Welty | Langston Hughes | Dorothy Parker | John F. Kennedy | Nora Ephron | Toni Morrison | John Kenneth Galbraith | Nikki Giovanni | James Baldwin | Kurt Vonnegut Jr. | Joan Didion | Derek Walcott | Margaret Atwood | Ursula K. Le Guin | Stephen King | Jhumpa Lahiri | Mario Vargas Llosa | Colson Whitehead | Patti Smith | Bill Gates1913H.G. Wells, the author of science fiction classics like “The Time Machine” and “The War of the Worlds,” admitted that he had a personal interest in this work about his fellow author George Gissing (who was oddly given the pseudonym Henry Maitland in a book that was clearly about him). “In so far that I have on several occasions encouraged Mr. Roberts to write it,” Wells wrote, “I feel myself a little involved in the responsibility for it.” He must have left Roberts feeling a bit less than grateful for the encouragement when he judged: “It is no use pretending that Mr. Roberts’s book is not downright bad, careless in statement, squalid in effect, poor as criticism, weakly planned and entirely without any literary distinction.”1949Nabokov was not yet a household name in the United States (that would come about a decade later, with the publication here of “Lolita”) when he reviewed Sartre’s philosophical novel about Antoine Roquentin, a French historian troubled by the very fact of existence. “Sartre’s name, I understand, is associated with a fashionable brand of cafe philosophy, and since for every so-called ‘existentialist’ one finds quite a few ‘suctorialists’ (if I may coin a polite term), this made-in-England translation of Sartre’s first novel, ‘La Nausée,’ should enjoy some success.”1949Williams, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for his play “A Streetcar Named Desire,” reviewed this debut novel by Bowles, which went on to be acclaimed as one of the best of the 20th century. The story mercilessly follows a young married couple from New York adrift in the North African desert. “I suspect that a good many people will read this book,” Williams wrote, “without once suspecting that it contains a mirror of what is most terrifying and cryptic within the Sahara of moral nihilism, into which the race of man now seems to be wandering blindly.”1950When she wrote this brief review, Patricia Highsmith was the author of one novel, “Strangers on a Train.” She would go on to worldwide fame for that and other thrillers, including the ones that feature Tom Ripley. The author she reviewed, the French mountaineer R. Frison-Roche, is now relatively obscure. “This is exactly the kind of novel one would expect a Chamonix guide to write — blunt in style and treatment, unevenly paced, about mountain climbing, of course, and authentic down to the last piton, the last breathtaking moment before the summit.” More tantalizingly, Highsmith added: “There is a delightful and unexpected chapter about a cow battle that is fully as dramatic as the mountain scaling.”1950One of the stranger matchups of big names in our archives is this review of the sports columnist Red Smith’s work by Shirley Jackson, the author of “The Lottery” and “The Haunting of Hill House.” Jackson wrote about her enjoyment of watching sports on TV. Though she had “limited knowledge” of sportswriters at the time, Smith’s book won her over. “There are some otherwise modest, sensitive females — I am among them — who are become brazen snatchers of the sports page from the morning paper, and only a book like Red Smith’s shows me what I have been missing by not getting into this field sooner. Reading ‘Out of the Red’ has been, actually, an educational experience unlike almost anything I have known since first looking into Chapman’s Homer.”1952Eudora Welty’s review of this timeless tale is a sheer delight, starting from its headline (“Life in the Barn Was Very Good”) and its first sentence (“E.B. White has written his book for children, which is nice for us older ones as it calls for big type”). Unlike contemporary reviews that get future classics “wrong,” Welty — who worked briefly as an editor at the Book Review during World War II — saw this accomplishment clear in the moment. “What the book is about is friendship on earth, affection and protection, adventure and miracle, life and death, trust and treachery, pleasure and pain, and the passing of time,” she wrote. “As a piece of work it is just about perfect, and just about magical in the way it is done.”1956In this review, Langston Hughes, an eminent literary figure and chronicler of the Black experience in the United States, took the measure of this first collection of essays by Baldwin. He was impressed: “He uses words as the sea uses waves, to flow and beat, advance and retreat, rise and take a bow in disappearing.” He suggested that Baldwin still had room to grow, but that “America and the world might well have a major contemporary commentator.”1957To no one’s surprise, Dorothy Parker, a member of the Algonquin Round Table, was funny in this review of work by her fellow humor writer. She begins it: “It is a strange force that compels a writer to be a humorist. It is a strange force, if you care to go back farther, that compels anyone to be a writer at all, but this is neither the time nor the place to bring up that matter. The writer’s way is rough and lonely, and who would choose it while there are vacancies in more gracious professions, such as, say, cleaning out ferryboats?” But while Parker was part of a “vicious circle,” and known for her piercing barbs, she happily praised Perelman, who, she wrote, “stands alone” in his field.1959John F. Kennedy was the author of three books and still a Massachusetts senator when he reviewed this book, an attempt to define for the world what America believed in beyond simply opposition to the Soviet Union and Communism. Larson was a Republican who had worked with labor issues and had been a top speechwriter for President Dwight D. Eisenhower. “Though the book’s style is somewhat discursive and here and there perhaps a trifle condescending,” Kennedy wrote, “Mr. Larson does succeed very well in portraying the dangers of analyzing American society in terms of class distinctions or rigid economic interests. Though it is not a new theme, he is very successful in reminding us of the ‘kaleidoscope of apparently inexplicable mixtures of political coloration across the landscape.’”1968In this review, the filmmaker, director and writer Nora Ephron marveled at how the young Reed got his show-business subjects to say the things they said to him. Those subjects included Barbra Streisand, Warren Beatty and Lucille Ball. Ephron’s opening is a classic: “Rex Reed is a saucy, snoopy, bitchy man who sees with sharp eyes and writes with a mean pen and succeeds in making voyeurs of us all. If any of this sounds like I don’t like Rex Reed, let me correct that impression. I love Rex Reed.”1971Toni Morrison had just one novel under her belt when this review was published in 1971. One of the joys in our archives is to see — in retrospect — the understated descriptions of those who wrote for us. Morrison’s read: “Toni Morrison, an editor in a New York publishing house, is the author of ‘The Bluest Eye.’” “It is a most remarkable collection,” she wrote of Bambara’s work. “Joy aches and pain chuckles in these pages, and the entire book leaves you with the impression of silk — which is so nice because it was made by a living thing that had something on its mind, its survival no doubt.”1971“Truth, not unconvincing humility, is the grandest virtue and accordingly I may observe that I am better qualified than any man alive to review a book on the public life of Chester Bowles.” The iconoclastic economist and prolific author John Kenneth Galbraith began his review this way because he and Bowles had held some of the same positions of power and had worked together on presidential campaigns. In so doing, they had become friends, which, Galbraith wrote, “is a disadvantage only if the book in question is bad. Only then do you have to consider whether the author should get the truth from you or someone else. This, fortunately, is an extremely good book.”1974The acclaimed poet Nikki Giovanni has written verse for children as well as adults, so she was the ideal reviewer for this novel, which was written for young readers but dealt with difficult, mature subjects. Hamilton’s novel, which won a Newbery Medal and a National Book Award, concerns a young boy hoping to save a local mountain from the ravages of strip mining. “‘M.C. Higgins, the Great’ is not an adorable book, not a lived‐happily‐ever‐after kind of story. It is warm, humane and hopeful and does what every book should do — creates characters with whom we can identify and for whom we care. … We’re glad Miss Hamilton is a writer. It makes the world just a little bit richer and our lives just a little bit warmer.”1975Kurt Vonnegut Jr. reviewed this account of the 1971 uprising at Attica prison written by Tom Wicker, who was a reporter, columnist and editor for The Times. The book mixed its reportage about the dramatic events at the prison with passages of autobiography. Leave it to Vonnegut to come up with a memorable comparison for what resulted: “The book is designed like a shish kebab, with novelistic scenes from ‘Wicker’s’ childhood and youth alternating with hard‐edged episodes from Attica, and with Tom Wicker himself as the skewer. The materials placed shoulder‐to‐shoulder on the skewer are as unlike as ripe peaches and hand grenades.”1976The Book Review has always taken pride in finding the right reviewers for the right books, and that is only heightened when a book is a true event, like Alex Haley’s “Roots,” which spent months at No. 1 on The Times’s best-seller list. The great James Baldwin’s piece is something still worth reading and considering today. He wrote of “Roots”: “It suggests with great power, how each of us, however unconsciously, can’t but be the vehicle of the history which has produced us. Well, we can perish in this vehicle, children, or we can move on up the road.”1979Talk about two heavyweights. On the cover of our Oct. 7, 1979, issue, Didion reviewed Mailer’s epic, genre-defying novel about the infamous Gary Gilmore, who murdered two people in Utah and later demanded that the state follow through with his execution for the crime. Much more than just the story of a crime and a very public death penalty debate, Mailer’s book captured the desperate side of life in the American West. “I think no one but Mailer could have dared this book,” Didion wrote. “The authentic Western voice, the voice heard in ‘The Executioner’s Song,’ is one heard often in life but only rarely in literature, the reason being that to truly know the West is to lack all will to write it down.”1983The poet Derek Walcott, who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992, reviewed this book about the French aviator Louis Blériot and his flight across the English Channel, 18 years before Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic. “Gaiety and true bravery are close in legend, and this spaciously crafted and modestly presented book is very much in the spirit of its subject,” Walcott wrote. “Fact is turned into magic, very quietly. The return to innocence requires gay and brave strides; the light on the way there is direct, the flight natural and simple, and ‘The Glorious Flight’ has made it.”1987Sometimes a book that will become an undisputed classic is met at the moment of its publication with appropriate awe. Such was the case with Morrison’s “Beloved,” a remarkable ghost story set in the years after the Civil War. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and in 2006 was named the best novel of the previous 25 years by a group of prominent writers, critics and editors polled by the Book Review. In her original review of the book in 1987, Margaret Atwood — the author of her own classics, like “The Handmaid’s Tale” — wrote: “‘Beloved’ is Toni Morrison’s fifth novel, and another triumph. Indeed, Morrison’s versatility and technical and emotional range appear to know no bounds. If there were any doubts about her stature as a pre-eminent American novelist, of her own or any other generation, ‘Beloved’ will put them to rest. In three words or less, it’s a hair-raiser.”1991The critic Harold Bloom once said that Ursula K. Le Guin had “raised fantasy into high literature for our time.” In this review of another iconic writer of literary science fiction, Le Guin captured the scope and relevance of Ballard’s themes. “The brilliant, obsessive fictions of J.G. Ballard circle through a round of almost canonical topics of modernist literature and film: the Conradian jungle and its white folk, consumerist America and the ugly American, popular cult figures such as astronauts and film stars, T.S. Eliot’s ‘waste land’ and ‘unreal city.’ Through these and other landscapes of alienation, stock figures move in meticulous patterns toward a predictably shocking conclusion. The voltage is high, but it’s all in the mind.”1999Dark imaginations collide in this review. (If Thomas Harris hadn’t invented Hannibal Lecter, perhaps eventually Stephen King would have?) This was Lecter’s first appearance in a novel in 11 years — and the first since the film adaptation of “The Silence of the Lambs” had made him a household name. “I don’t think many of the Danielle Steel crowd will be rushing out to buy a book in which one character is eaten from the inside out by a ravenous moray eel — but for those who like what Harris can do so brilliantly, no book report is required.”2000We like to keep our eyes peeled for the newest talents here at the Book Review, and here is a vintage example. About a month after this review was published, Jhumpa Lahiri would win a Pulitzer Prize for her debut collection of stories, “Interpreter of Maladies.” And here she was reviewing the debut novel by Mohsin Hamid, who was embarking on his own award-winning career. “Like Fitzgerald, Hamid writes about the slippery ties between the extremely wealthy and those who hover, and generally stumble, in money’s glare,” Lahiri wrote. “Hamid also sets the action over a single, degenerate summer, when passions run high and moral lassitude prevails. And like Fitzgerald, Hamid probes the vulgarity and violence that lurk beneath a surface of affluence and ease.”2000The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature, delivered a sweeping review of this biography of the Argentine writer Manuel Puig. In it, Vargas Llosa considered everything from the influence of the movies on Puig to what made his work so original to whether that work has the “revolutionary transcendence attributed to it by Levine and other critics.” He praised Levine’s own work: “This fascinating book is indispensable for anyone interested in Puig’s work (which Levine, the translator of several of his novels into English, knows to perfection) and in the close connection between film and literature, a defining characteristic of cultural life in the late 20th century; both are described with intelligence and an abundance of information. I found occasional errors, but these in no way diminish the virtues of a book in which rigor and readability walk arm in arm.”2006As we celebrate 125 years of the Book Review, we’ll spend time not just in the distant past but in the vibrant present. Few writers this century are as acclaimed as Colson Whitehead, the author of several novels and the winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for “The Underground Railroad” (2016). In 2019, Richard Powers joined the list of Pulitzer winners as well, for “The Overstory.” But back in 2006, when both were simply very acclaimed authors, Whitehead reviewed this novel about a man who suffers from a rare cognitive disorder after a near-fatal car accident. “Part of the joy of reading Powers over the years has been his capacity for revelation,” Whitehead wrote. “His scientific discourses point to how the world works, but the struggles of his characters … help us understand how we work.”2014A longtime rock star and poet, Patti Smith became an award-winning memoirist with the publication of “Just Kids” in 2010. We also think she’s a fine reviewer. She brought her deep knowledge of the work of Haruki Murakami to this assessment of his 13th novel. “This is a book for both the new and experienced reader. It has a strange casualness, as if it unfolded as Murakami wrote it; at times, it seems like a prequel to a whole other narrative. The feel is uneven, the dialogue somewhat stilted, either by design or flawed in translation. Yet there are moments of epiphany gracefully expressed, especially in regard to how people affect one another.”2018Yes, we love to publish work by prominent novelists, essayists, poets, journalists, historians. But sometimes it’s a thrill to have someone weigh in who is (very, very well) known for something other than books. And who better to review a look at the 21st century than Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, who did so much to shape the world we live in? “Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. All three of his books wrestle with some version of the same question: What will give our lives meaning in the decades and centuries ahead? … It’s no criticism to say that Harari hasn’t produced a satisfying answer yet. Neither has anyone else. So I hope he turns more fully to this question in the future.”</body>

	<title>La paz fea de El Salvador</title>
	<author>Óscar Martínez</author>
	<body>SAN SALVADOR — El Salvador firmó sus Acuerdos de Paz hace 29 años y desde entonces no ha vivido en paz. Ha vivido sin guerra civil, lo que no ha sido poco ni suficiente. Eso ha quedado claro estos días.El aniversario de aquel pacto que acabó con 12 años de conflicto armado ocurrió hace un par de semanas y tuvo que haber pasado sin pena ni gloria, pero el presidente Nayib Bukele lo convirtió en todo un evento que terminó con su propia etiqueta en redes sociales. Lo que Bukele hizo suena pueril de solo pronunciarse: utilizó nuestra guerra y nuestra paz como arma arrojadiza contra sus opositores políticos. “¡La guerra fue una farsa! Fue una farsa como los Acuerdos de Paz. ‘Ay, está mancillando los Acuerdos de Paz’. Sí, los mancillo, porque fueron una farsa, una negociación entre dos cúpulas o ¿qué beneficios le trajo al pueblo salvadoreño?”, dijo Bukele a mediados de diciembre durante un discurso público.Las palabras de Bukele escandalizaron a muchos, pero también el escenario donde las pronunció. Lo hizo durante un discurso en el caserío El Mozote, donde en 1981, con la guerra recién iniciada, un batallón militar masacró a cerca de 1000 personas desarmadas.En la tarima, observando al presidente aquel día, estaba Sofía Romero, una mujer que sobrevivió luego de huir tras ser violada por cinco militares en los meses previos a la masacre. De las cuatro personas que estaban en la tarima, Sofía fue la única que no tuvo turno de palabra. La sobreviviente fue solo espectadora de aquel evento.Bukele se vende como un mesías, como el parteaguas en la historia de este país y no pretende permitir que le compita ninguna guerra, con todos sus magnicidios y masacres; ni tampoco una paz, con todos sus logros e imperfecciones.El estilo autoritario, 29 años después de salir de una batalla contra regímenes militares, sigue gustando en El Salvador. La acumulación del poder es el camino, según la gran mayoría. Somos los herederos de una paz fea. Importante, necesaria, pero fea.Durante décadas en el poder, los partidos que gobernaron la posguerra, la exguerrilla del FMLN y el derechista ARENA, llevaron al país a otras guerras nuevas, donde sus errores en el manejo de la seguridad pública terminaron convirtiéndonos en la nación más homicida del mundo en años recientes. Los hombres a los que esos partidos eligieron para gobernar nuestra paz saquearon este país a manos llenas. Tres expresidentes han pasado de diferentes formas por procesos relacionados con su corrupción: dos de la derecha, uno de la izquierda. Afearon nuestra paz durante años.Ahora Bukele no pretende deformarla más, sino sacarla de la discusión llamándole farsa.El repudio a las palabras de Bukele sobrevivió a las fiestas navideñas y perduró hasta la conmemoración del 29 aniversario de la Paz este 16 de enero. Un centenar de académicos publicó una carta abierta exigiendo al presidente honrar la memoria de una guerra que dejó más de 75.000 muertos. Geoff Thale, presidente de la Oficina en Washington para Asuntos Latinoamericanos (WOLA), un influyente laboratorio de ideas en aquella capital del poder político, publicó un análisis diciendo que las declaraciones de Bukele eran tristes, pero no sorprendentes.Estoy de acuerdo: las palabras del presidente fueron ofensivas, violentas incluso, ignorantes, pero también conscientes y previsibles. Reflejan la visión política de Bukele, en la que su autoritarismo y megalomanía son principios rectores y alcanzan nuevas cimas en el transcurso de su mandato. Esta vez, Bukele dejó clara su intención: la memoria de la guerra y de los Acuerdos de Paz no le sirven para sus aspiraciones políticas. Recordar un conflicto y su resolución no funciona porque él no fue el protagonista. Era apenas un niño cuando aquello terminó en 1992.Pero el intento de anular a los demás sí le ha funcionado en su carrera política y es su declarada intención para las elecciones legislativas y municipales de febrero: ganó la presidencia asegurando que acabaría con “los mismos de siempre”, a pesar de que él proviene de años de función pública como miembro del izquierdista FMLN y algunos de sus candidatos y aliados más visibles sean políticos curtidos en los partidos de la derecha salvadoreña. Ahora, en estos comicios que son una meta para él, el eslogan de campaña reza que todos esos que no están con él “van para afuera”. Para Bukele, todos los políticos que lo precedieron y ahora no lo aplauden son un lastre, y su estrategia pasa por anularlos en las urnas y en la memoria de los salvadoreños.Las redes sociales fueron protagonistas de esta conmemoración. Un hashtag en el centro de todo: #ProhibidoOlvidarSV. Decenas de miles de salvadoreños compartimos microhistorias de la guerra desde esa etiqueta, hablamos de nuestras muertes y memorias. Fue inspirador que miles de adultos jóvenes, la generación de los hijos de la guerra, asumieran como una afrenta personal las declaraciones de Bukele y se consideraran, aunque sea a través de un acto simbólico, guardianes de esa memoria. Fue un performance potente que atrajo mucha atención.Sin embargo, estos días dejaron también un recordatorio ineludible: las flaquezas de nuestra paz siguen ahí. El meteórico ascenso de Bukele es un claro reflejo de ello.Por más tuits, retuits y me gusta que hayan logrado las microhistorias de la guerra, ese presidente que despreció su legado es el hombre fuerte de la política en El Salvador. Su nota, a más de aún año de gestión y aún en la encuesta donde sale menos favorecido, sigue arriba del 70 por ciento y está camino a unas elecciones legislativas donde todo apunta a que los salvadoreños le darán más poder que a ningún líder de la postguerra. Pronto, Bukele contará con cientos de alcaldes y decenas de diputados sumisos a él.La paz fue el fin de un conflicto, pero también el inicio de una nueva vida en la que, por ejemplo, ya nadie te tortura por leer un libro de Marx. La paz trajo beneficios y obligaciones, pero muchos políticos de antes y de hoy se han olvidado poco a poco de esto último. La paz es su huérfana.Es claro que la ciudadanía debe ser la defensora del legado de los Acuerdos de Paz, porque será la que más sufra su detrimento. Es evidente que la vocación democrática de esta ciudadanía no es su principal rasgo. Pero también es cierto que aún es posible cambiar eso, y que ello pasa por despreciar el desprecio de políticos como Bukele y honrar nuestros Acuerdos de Paz como lo que fueron: la promesa de un futuro que no hemos alcanzado y nunca un arma electoral. Y nunca, pregunten a los torturados y los huérfanos, una farsa.Óscar Martínez es jefe de redacción de El Faro, autor de Los migrantes que no importan y Una historia de violencia y coautor de El Niño de Hollywood, sobre la MS-13.</body>

	<title>Portman to Retire in Ohio, Expanding 2022 Battle for Senate</title>
	<author>Jonathan Martin</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a Republican with deep ties to the former party establishment, announced on Monday that he would not seek re-election in 2022, underscoring the rightward shift of his party and opening a major battleground in what will be a bruising national fight for Senate control.One of the most seasoned legislators in the Senate, Mr. Portman, 65, voiced frustration with the deep polarization and partisanship in Washington as one of the factors in his decision to step aside after a successful career in the House, executive branch and Senate.“It has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision,” Mr. Portman said in a statement that was widely viewed as a surprise so soon after the last election.Mr. Portman, a top trade and budget official in the administration of George W. Bush, was once regarded as a conservative stalwart. But as his party shifted to the right in recent years, he had come to be seen as one of the few right-of-center Republican senators interested in striking bipartisan deals, an increasingly perilous enterprise at a time when the party’s core supporters have shown a penchant for punishing moderation.Mr. Portman was one of the lawmakers responsible for pushing through the new North American trade deal in 2019. He was also part of a bipartisan coalition that crafted a pandemic relief measure late last year and applied pressure to the House and Senate leadership to embrace and pass it after months of delay.With the Senate increasingly a gridlocked battlefield, Mr. Portman is the latest Republican to assess the political landscape and opt for an exit, putting seats in play in competitive states. Senators Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania have announced they will not be running again. Former President Donald J. Trump won Ohio soundly, but he only narrowly prevailed in North Carolina and was defeated in Pennsylvania.Mr. Portman is highly regarded by members of both parties.“Rob and I haven’t always agreed with one another,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Mr. Portman’s Democratic counterpart in Ohio, wrote on Twitter. “But we’ve always been able to put our differences aside to do what’s best for Ohio.”Mr. Portman sought to maneuver carefully around Mr. Trump while he was in office, carefully criticizing the former president’s actions and statements he disagreed with while praising Mr. Trump’s policies. He voted against removing Mr. Trump from office in the Senate impeachment trial last year, and is considered unlikely to convict the former president in the forthcoming one, even though he will not face voters again.The senator’s decision to retire rather than seek a third term illustrated how difficult it has become for more mainstream Republicans to navigate the current political environment, with hard-right allies of Mr. Trump insisting that Republican members of Congress side with them or face primary contests.Mr. Portman called it a “tough time to be in public service.”“We live in an increasingly polarized country where members of both parties are being pushed further to the right and further to the left,” he said, “and that means too few people who are actively looking to find common ground.”With the Senate split 50-50 and Democrats in the majority by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris breaking any ties, Republicans would need a net gain of one seat to take back the majority they lost this month after six years in control.Given the Republican tilt of Ohio, which supported Mr. Trump in the presidential election, Republicans would hold the advantage in the race, particularly in a midterm election where the party out of presidential power typically fares well. But the open seat could make it easier for Democrats to compete, particularly if Republicans choose a hard-right candidate with the potential to alienate independents and suburban voters.One of those hard-right prospects, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, was among the first names mentioned on Monday as a possible replacement for Mr. Portman. Perhaps Mr. Trump’s staunchest ally in the House, Mr. Jordan was the former president’s principal defender on the House floor when Mr. Trump was impeached for a second time this month.Mr. Jordan’s frequent Fox News appearances have also earned him national fame with conservatives; he had over $5 million left over when his 2020 campaign ended.Yet his profile has also made Mr. Jordan a political lightning rod, and a number of Ohio Democrats believe he would be the easiest Republican to defeat. If he did enter the race, he would likely have company in the primary. Representative Steve Stivers, a Columbus-area lawmaker and the former chairman of the House campaign committee, indicated to associates on Monday that he was considering a bid. Other potential Republicans included Lt. Gov. Jon Husted; Jane Timken, the chairwoman of the state party; and Representatives Bill Johnson and Michael R. Turner.The roster of potential Democratic candidates is smaller in what has become a Republican-dominated state. The two most formidable candidates could be Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton and Representative Tim Ryan. Ms. Whaley has been expected to run for governor, but when asked on Monday if she would enter the Senate contest, she said she was “thinking about it.”Mr. Ryan, who represents a heavily industrial slice of northeastern Ohio, has repeatedly mulled statewide campaigns, only to run for re-election. He did, however, mount a long-shot presidential campaign in 2019 and has made little secret of his angst in the House, having once tried to dethrone Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Ryan may have another good reason to finally run statewide: After he won by a smaller-than-expected margin last year, Ohio Republicans could carve up his seat in redistricting to make it hard for him to win.Whoever emerges for the Democrats will confront a state that has shifted sharply to the right after decades as the country’s quintessential political battleground. Mr. Brown is the last statewide Democratic officeholder, having won re-election against lackluster opposition in 2018.Mr. Portman said he made his plans public on Monday to give others time to prepare for a costly statewide race. His advisers said that besides his unhappiness with the partisanship of Washington, he was wary of making an eight-year commitment that would keep him in the Senate into his 70s.</body>

	<title>Word + Quiz: perspicacious</title>
	<author>The Learning Network</author>
	<body>1. mentally acute or penetratingly discerning2. acutely insightful and wise_________The word perspicacious has appeared in six articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Sept. 5 in the book review “Recreational Adrenaline: Three Sizzling New Thrillers” by Sarah Lyall:This debut novel is a cerebral box of delights that begins when Julia Hart, a publisher, travels to an unnamed Mediterranean island to visit Grant McAllister, who vanished decades earlier after producing a single volume of mystery stories. Her firm wants to republish the book, “The White Murders,” a collection of seven fiendish murder mysteries that each reflects a different approach to the genre. (They are all gems. One turns out to be a diabolically plotted homage to Agatha Christie’s classic “And Then There Were None.”)From the cat-and-mouse present-day discussions that alternate chapters with the original short stories, we discover that Julia is an unusually perspicacious detective as well as a sharp-eyed editor. She starts to pick up subtle narrative inconsistencies in the stories — mixed-up words, chronological anomalies, out-of-place details. A creepiness sets in; no one is who he (or she, maybe) seems. Why is Grant so vague about his past? What does Julia really want?_________The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

	<title>They Say Capitalism Is Over. Want to Buy a Piece?</title>
	<author>Sophie Haigney</author>
	<body>When Jack Carlson wears his mom’s old green Lehman Brothers sweatshirt around New York City, people try to buy it off his back.“People will just come up to me and offer me money for it in restaurants,” said Mr. Carlson, 33, the founder of the clothing company Rowing Blazers, which sells a contemporary version of the so-called banker bag, a Wall Street accessory that dates to 1978. Branded merchandise of defunct investment banks that were key architects of the financial crisis in 2008: officially hot, if in an arch, allusive way.Buying and selling products associated with the crash has become, paradoxically, a thriving niche market. So too has memorabilia associated with other disasters in recent financial history, like the dot-com bubble and the Enron scandal.In a Bloomberg article in which financial experts described how they would personally invest or spend $1 million, Akshay Shah, the founder of the investment firm Kyma Capital, said, “When businesses go bust, they leave behind reminders of corporate power and the effects of time.” eBay sellers, he noted, have scooped up branded items and then offer them for sale “at a pretty substantial multiple after a suitable passage of time — like the $500 Lehman sticky notes.” (Sounding a note of caution, Mr. Shah said, “The key to success here would be volume of products and being patient.”)These days, however, there are also more affordable items on hand, a Lehman Brothers-branded baby bib ($59.59 on eBay) and an emergency evacuation kit ($98.99). A Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. certificate dated to 1987 will set you back $295, however — even though the stock it once represented is worth nothing. And an Enron “Conduct of Business Affairs Booklet” is on sale for $395 on the “stock market gifts and collectibles” website Wall Street Treasures.“I’ve been selling a lot of Enron memorabilia lately,” said Scott Davidson, 38, an accountant and financial planner who runs Wall Street Treasures, and has been selling finance-related memorabilia through various channels for nine years. “There’s a lot of appetite. Everyone loves a good scandal.”Among the current items Mr. Davidson has in stock is a framed promotional piece that displays a “Most Innovative Company” Award that went to Enron four years in a row. It’s now on sale for $1,495. “Of course, the only innovative thing about them was their accounting scheme,” he said. “The innovation was the fraud.”In a disorienting boomerang of value, a once-valuable stock certificate becomes totally worthless, and then, in an afterlife as a collector’s item, becomes more valuable than it was before. Why, one might ask, is anyone buying this stuff? Financial scandals and crises, which left millions impoverished, might seem like odd fodder for office décor or workout sweatshirts.“I think it partly has to do with collective identity,” Mr. Davidson said. “So many people owned a piece of Enron at one time, through their mutual funds. Everyone knew the story.” Personal identity is part of it, too; he often gets contacted by former employees of defunct companies looking for souvenirs of their time there.The popularity of these cultural artifacts has led to a whole subgenre of new offshoots and homages, like Rowing Blazers’ banker bag. There are two versions, emblazoned with “Duke&amp;Duke Commodities Brokers” or “Pierce&amp;Pierce Mergers and Acquisitions” — both fictional firms from movies.To produce it, Mr. Carlson worked with Warden Brooks, the company founded by Joan Killian Gallagher that made the original canvas bag in 1978, which came to telegraph “New York finance” in the 1980s and 1990s. “It has been a staple for interns, IB conferences, special events, elite clubs, associations, university and prep school reunions, off-site meetings, corporate programs and incentive groups,” Warden Brooks’s website proclaims.The Rowing Blazers version ($135) is one of the company’s most popular items. “The banker bag is such a polarizing object,” Mr. Carlson said. “For some people it’s this really important status symbol, and for others it’s kind of a symbol of everything that went wrong.” Rowing Blazers also makes a yellow hat ($48) that reads “FINANCE,” in black letters — which is, he said, the best-selling object on the site.Sometimes people wearing FINANCE hats are simply people who work in finance and think finance is cool, Mr. Carlson said. But perhaps more often it’s an ironic gesture. “The people who are buying the hat, or the banker bag, are not necessarily people who are idolizing these extinct financial institutions,” he said. “There’s almost like a sense of appropriation or a sense of empowerment that comes along with it.” (Someone who works in finance did once email Mr. Carlson to accuse him of appropriating financial culture, he said.)The popularity of these items has surprised him. “I really did not expect this to take off like that,” he said. “It’s so bizarre.” Occasionally Mr. Carlson will sell vintage items, like a knitted Merrill Lynch sweater emblazoned with bulls that went for $300 to $400, but they go out of stock very quickly.This buying and selling of finance-adjacent memorabilia is a cousin of scripophily, the collecting of stock certificates: a niche hobby among, mostly, financial professionals and history buffs. Paper stock and bond certificates, which are being phased out of circulation, are often highly decorative. Bob Kerstein, 68, founded scripophily.com, the primary website for buying and selling stock and bond certificates, in 1996. He now has roughly 14,000 of them on the website, ranging from stock certificates for 19th-century mining companies to Ask Jeeves stock issued in 2001, with Jeeves himself on the top.“The financial crisis is one of our biggest sellers right now,” Mr. Kerstein said. “We have mortgage obligation bonds on our website, and people like those a lot, because that was really the starting point of the Great Recession.” When he first started, he said, collectors were most interested in the older certificates but now, “railroads are deader than a doorknob,” he said. “Modern certificates are more popular.”Other popular items include Trump-branded stock certificates, and those for defunct dot-com companies. Even the names of companies, like MP3.com and Fashionmall.com, can instantly conjure stories about the overspeculation that happened in the heyday of the early web, when it seemed like almost everyone with a website could find investors.“Having one of these on the wall in your office can be a reminder that in the stock market you can make a lot of money, but you can lose a lot too,” Mr. Kerstein said.The idea that objects can impute lessons about the follies of money management is not a new one. William Goetzmann, a professor at the Yale School of Management, is the co-author of the book “The Great Mirror of Folly: Finance, Culture, and the Crash of 1720,” inspired partly by memorabilia of the first great stock market crash.This crash, popularly known as the South Sea Bubble, inspired a range of scrapbooks and satirical drawings that pointed to the absurdities of speculating. Playing cards even emerged out of this crash printed with satirical drawings; people may well have gambled with cards that poked fun at the feverish atmosphere of trading and speculating that led to the crash.“Saving the artifacts from stock market crises is about more than just saying, ‘We want something to remember it,’” Mr. Goetzmann said. “It’s about having something that you can use ironically or satirically to force yourself to realize that human behavior can lead to these crises.”This seems to be part of what’s at work in the obsession with Lehman Brothers and Enron memorabilia — not just memorializing scandals or crises, but also processing them through irony. Sometimes that means buying and selling in a mode of speculation that mimics the very thing you’re mocking.Or, sometimes it’s simpler than that. As Mr. Davidson said, “What else are you going to get your financial adviser?”</body>

	<title>Silicon Valley Workers Have Had Enough</title>
	<author>Moira Weigel</author>
	<body>This month, Big Tech pulled the plug on the loudest man on the internet. The decisions by Facebook and Twitter to remove Donald Trump coincided with a growing public concern about the power of tech platforms to invade privacy, monopolize markets and swing elections. Bipartisan political actions, including major antitrust suits, are also underway. But as tech executives prepare for these battles, they also face an adversary closer to home: the militant white-collar tech worker.Twitter employees long agitated for Mr. Trump’s suspension from the platform. At Facebook, demands from the rank and file for a tougher stance against his posts circulated for months, inspiring internal petitions and even a virtual walkout. Similarly, Amazon’s management cut ties with Parler, a social media platform popular on the far right, only hours after a group of Amazon employees called for the company leadership to do so.Historically, white-collar workers in tech, including software engineers and product designers, have rarely engaged in collective action. They tended to view themselves as professionals, future founders, members of a corporate family or the creative class — hardly the sort to band together against their bosses. Indeed, the notion of loving one’s job so much that it doesn’t even feel like work is a Silicon Valley export.But after the 2016 election, a growing number at companies like Google and Amazon began to change their thinking. When their chief executives seemed eager to accommodate the man who was then president, these employees pledged not to build databases identifying people by race, religion or national origin. Keeping such promises, however, would require more than talking to one’s manager about surveillance or the security state.So they waged collective action campaigns around many issues, including the weaponization of artificial intelligence and tech’s carbon footprint, drawing inspiration from the thousands of service workers on Silicon Valley campuses who successfully unionized around the same time. The white-collar employees who supported their efforts learned the fundamentals of organizing, realizing they might stand to gain from it as well.Their gaze also turned inward. Early in the Trump presidency, a series of high-profile lawsuits and scandals heightened scrutiny of systemic racism and sexism in their industry. Employees could not count on their managers or human resources departments for protection; here, too, they needed to act collectively. In November 2018 more than 20,000 Google employees walked out of offices in 50 cities all over the world to protest sexism and racism at their company — one of the largest international labor actions in modern history.Critics of the tech worker movement have lumped it in with a broader culture war that raged throughout Trump’s presidency. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, saw a “woke segment” of a coddled young work force; The Wall Street Journal editorial board, “campus-style political activism.” This misinterprets the significance of these actions. Workers organizing against Pentagon and Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts want more power over the content of their work — the kind of code they write and how it can be used. Workers organizing against harassment and discrimination want more power over the conditions of their work. Content and conditions are connected: The question of power in the workplace is at stake in both.To build and consolidate this power, white-collar tech workers have formed unions of their own. In February 2020, Kickstarter employees voted to unionize in affiliation with the Office and Professional Employees International Union. This month, employees at Alphabet, the parent company of Google, announced the creation of the Alphabet Workers Union, a membership organization to strengthen collective action within the company.Some tech executives have argued that social issues have no place in the office. Others have argued that tech employees are too privileged to organize. Mike Solana, a venture capitalist, claimed that the union’s members were “appropriating the language of exploited coal miners.” In other words, Googlers aren’t real workers; they’re not oppressed enough. Interestingly, many people once argued that coal miners were not real workers, because they were not directly supervised and often owned their own tools and hired their own helpers.These criticisms are understandable. The decades-long decline of the labor movement has left it so weak that many Americans know little about its history. In fact, workers have often organized not only to improve their wages, but also to gain more control over their work — especially when it had an outsize effect on the world. In the 1970s, employees at Polaroid and IBM, two major tech firms of their day, protested their companies’ business with South Africa’s government during apartheid.The suggestion that people who work at tech companies are too privileged to organize also seems dubious. Alphabet Workers Union membership, for instance, includes contractors who do not enjoy the high salaries or generous benefits of senior software engineers. And even better-compensated tech workers routinely experience racism and sexism. Is it a privilege to not be insulted or assaulted at work? Studies show that harassment both reflects and reproduces inequality, by preventing victims from seeking promotions and raises, if not pushing them out of the company altogether.Critics of the tech worker movement also imply that collective action is suitable only for the most immiserated workers. But organizing can help protect people against many kinds of harm, especially in a country where most people can be fired at any time for almost any reason. Indeed, about a month before the Alphabet union launched, Timnit Gebru, a high-profile Black female computer scientist who helped lead Google’s ethical-artificial-intelligence team, said the company fired her for being too critical of its hiring practices and the biases built into artificial intelligence systems.With Mr. Trump’s departure from office, the sense of crisis that proved so mobilizing — and unifying — may fade. But the contracts and conditions that workers have protested remain in place, as do the networks they have formed. The workers pushing for changes in tech firms may forge more direct relationships with policymakers like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two of the Democratic Party’s biggest advocates of robust antitrust enforcement against Big Tech. Both senators have tweeted in support of the Alphabet Workers Union.But any regulation is likely to be slow moving. For better or worse, in an era of extreme corporate concentration, organized workers within the ranks of a company like Google may be the strongest lever the public has for forcing tech executives to be transparent and accountable.In the continuing debates over platform power, one set of voices will be coming from inside the house.Mr. Tarnoff and Ms. Weigel are co-founders of Logic magazine and the editors of the recent book “Voices From the Valley: Tech Workers Talk About What They Do — and How They Do It.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>The Impermanence of Beauty</title>
	<author>Florence Fabricant</author>
	<body>Has vegan food ever been so beautiful? “Kajitsu,” a cookbook explaining the Zen Buddhist Shojin cuisine of Japan, offers page after page of magnificent seasonal dishes, with recipes. The book’s all based on the Murray Hill restaurant Kajitsu (now closed because of the pandemic), which moved to its present location from the East Village in 2013. And as the book explains, the restaurant, founded in 2009, will close permanently next year to respect the impermanence of things, according to Buddhist philosophy. So if you wish to remember the restaurant, or would be inspired to tackle its vegan recipes, including the most astonishing chirashi sushi you’re likely to encounter, this book is for you. But simpler recipes — like carrot potage, roast eggplant rice, and bamboo shoot and mountain vegetable sukiyaki, which require little background in Japanese ingredients beyond dashi, soy sauce and miso — are relatively few. Many require items like magnolia leaves, lily bulbs, kuromame (sweet black beans) and abura-age (a kind of fried tofu). The book, at least in its English translation, desperately needs a glossary and shopping sources.“Kajitsu: A Shojin Restaurant’s Season in the City” (FUKA Honten, $90), kitchenartsandletters.com.Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

	<title>An Unleashed Dog, Sentenced to Death After an Attack</title>
	<author>Susanne Craig</author>
	<body>Jasper bit down into Chloe’s neck as if it were a jelly doughnut. My sweet senior dog did not stand a chance against the pit bull, half her age and holding a grudge.Chloe, whom I rescued from a shelter in New Jersey more than a decade ago, has been my best friend and constant companion ever since. I am a reporter at The New York Times. Over the last five years, as I was holed up working on investigations about Donald Trump’s finances, Chloe’s job was to guard the president’s tax return information. She kept me sane. I kept her safe. Until now.Chloe and I live in a cabin in the Catskill Mountains. My exercise is hers, long walks together, through fields, forests and often country lanes in our neighborhood. On the morning of the attack we were on one of those roads, with my friend Shawna Richer and her dog, Scout.Jasper’s frenzied barking began as we approached his house. I looked over at Shawna. Silently we calculated the possibility of passing with Chloe and Scout, both leashed, as swiftly and softly as possible. Jasper had other ideas. He shot off the porch and across the sprawling front yard as if launched from a slingshot.Then he stopped at the edge of the property. He sized all of us up and his eyes locked on Chloe, a solid 60-pound Labrador-basset hound mix who is 12 years old. Suddenly a woman emerged from the house, screaming for Jasper to come back. Instead he advanced toward Chloe until they were nose to nose. Then he lunged, locking his jaw around her neck.A few days later, one of the dogs was on death row and the other recovering from deep puncture wounds to her neck and abdomen. One person was in the hospital.Chloe first encountered Jasper two summers ago. She was on a walk, on leash, with my brother, David. They met the wayward pit bull alone on a road. Jasper came at Chloe but David kicked him. Jasper went running. Chloe escaped without harm. We did not report the incident, something I now regret.For many dog owners, part of the allure of country life is wide-open spaces where their pets can run free. I used to be one of these people, but over the years I learned the hard way the importance of a leash.I have encountered a few dogs like Jasper, the unsupervised ones that can turn violent in an instant. Jasper had quite a history I learned about anecdotally only after it was too late. Another neighbor’s dog had been attacked. Animal control had a record of it. A few years back Jasper had bitten one of his owners, the police told me.I held onto Chloe as we all fought to separate the dogs. Jasper’s teeth were deep in Chloe’s neck and her fur was flecked with blood. Shawna kicked Jasper in the chest and tried to wedge herself between the dogs’ muzzles, while at the same time trying to keep Scout out of the fight.The woman fought hopelessly to gain control over Jasper. As she grasped at his collar, he bit her hard.On our walks we see all sorts of dogs, and owners. There are the off-leash dogs who come bounding toward me. The owner is always nearby, assuring me their pet is friendly. This drives me crazy. These people are taking a huge risk, blindly betting their dog will mix with mine.Then there are dogs like Jasper, dangerous and often roaming around alone. After Chloe’s first brush with Jasper I bought pepper spray. But when he came for her this time, I wasn’t carrying it.In the days after the attack I heard from friends who felt that Jasper’s being a pit bull was to blame. I fault only the owners, who failed to leash Jasper. After Chloe was attacked I watched “The Champions,” a documentary about the fate of the pit bulls abused by Michael Vick, the professional football player who served time in federal prison for operating an illegal dogfighting operation. Dozens of pit bulls were seized and rehomed. The movie is a testament to the idea that many dogs, regardless of breed or the conditions they were raised in, can be rehabilitated with proper attention, training and love.In the right home, with informed, responsible owners, even Jasper could have had a safe, happy life. But in that home, on that morning, he was only dangerous.As his grip tightened on Chloe’s neck and I saw her blood on my jeans, the reality that she could well die on this road overcame me. Through tears I said goodbye to her. I told her I was sorry.The bloody assault continued. At one point Chloe’s big brown paws covered Jasper’s face as if to say, “Please, please stop.” Finally the woman’s shouts raised her father, who came running. He snapped a leash to Jasper’s collar, and pried his jaws from Chloe. They retreated to the house.Shawna and I collapsed to our knees on the blood-spattered road. Fight or flight had overwhelmed us. We couldn’t catch our breath. Our lungs burned. Our jackets and jeans were covered in blood.I looked over at Chloe. Bitten, bleeding, but alive. Scout, who remarkably had stayed out of the fight, pressed her body against Shawna. We trudged the short distance home in silence.My vet treated Chloe’s puncture wounds, two on the neck, one on her side. She said we were lucky. Chloe’s thick neck rolls and collar had absorbed some of the attack and probably saved her life. She got a rabies booster and antibiotics.The woman went to the hospital with a hand injury. A few days later, I received an email from her father.He said he had rescued Jasper as a puppy. “I wish you could see him with his family. He was a kind, loving pet, but not so with strangers and other dogs,” he wrote. “I turned my back and he slipped away. I can only say I wish it never happened. Our family is devastated.”The local animal control officer told me the family had to surrender Jasper to quarantine because his rabies shots were out of date. Initially there was talk that Jasper would be returned to the owner. Later I learned he would have to be put down.“It’s for the best and we all know it,” the father wrote.As I read the email, sitting in my car in the parking lot of a local Home Depot, I began to sob. I was devastated for Jasper and his family. I believed they loved their dog. I wanted to find him another home, a pit bull sanctuary, something. I imagined their goodbye at the humane society. I wished we’d never walked by their house that morning. I wished Jasper had been leashed.Chloe is recovering from her injuries. For weeks after the attack my body was covered in bruises from holding Chloe tight to me as Jasper attacked her. Shawna is anxious on walks now and carries a large stick. I do not leave the house without pepper spray.A few nights later I saw a post about Jasper on Instagram. He looked peaceful and sweet in the photograph. “Rest in peace Jasper, my heart is breaking,” the caption read.It made me sad for everything that didn’t have to happen.</body>

	<title>Spring Training Appears on Track, Even if Arizona Wants a Delay</title>
	<author>Tyler Kepner</author>
	<body>Pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report in about three weeks to spring training camps in Arizona and Florida, just as they have each February for decades. That is the plan, anyway, and players are sticking to it — even though one state does not want them quite yet.The mayors or city managers of the eight Arizona spring training communities, and the president of the Salt River-Pima Maricopa Indian Community, signed a letter to Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, on Monday, asking to delay the start of spring training.“In view of the current state of the pandemic in Maricopa County — with one of the nation’s highest infection rates — we believe it is wise to delay the start of spring training to allow for the Covid-19 situation to improve here,” the letter said, speaking for the Cactus League Association’s task force on Covid-19 compliance. “This position is based on public data from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which projects a sharp decline in infections in Arizona by mid-March (an estimated 9,712 daily infections on February 15 and 3,072 daily infections on March 15).”The letter goes on to acknowledge that M.L.B. cannot unilaterally decide to delay spring training, a point the players’ union reiterated in its statement.“While we, of course, share the goals of a safe spring training and regular season,” the statement read, “M.L.B. has repeatedly assured us that it has instructed its teams to be prepared for an on-time start to spring training and the regular season and we continue to devote all our efforts to making sure that that takes place as safely as possible.”The players, naturally, are eager to hold a regular 162-game schedule after earning only 37 percent of their 2020 salaries in a 60-game season. Any delay could potentially threaten a schedule that is on track to begin April 1.A statement from M.L.B. said the league would “continue to consult with public health authorities, medical experts, and the Players Association” on any possible schedule adjustments. But trust has largely eroded between the sides, which struggled to find common ground on rules for the delayed 2020 season and have been unable to reach an agreement to keep some of the modifications in place.The league has told teams to proceed as if there would be no expanded playoffs or designated hitters in the National League, as there were in 2020. The league and the union both want such changes, but the players believe the expanded playoff format is worth more than the universal D.H. and are leery of giving away leverage with their collective bargaining agreement expiring after this season.</body>

	<title>Trump’s Pardon of Bannon Could Raise Risk for 3 Co-Defendants</title>
	<author>Benjamin Weiser</author>
	<body>Of all the pardons former President Donald Trump granted in the hours before he left office, perhaps none was as galling to his critics, government watchdog groups and even some of his allies as the pardon of his former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon.Mr. Bannon, 67, had been charged with conspiring to swindle donors to a private fund to build a wall along the Mexican border, siphoning off more than $1 million for personal and other expenses, the indictment said.Even The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, a conservative bastion, suggested Mr. Bannon’s pardon was unseemly and egregious, asserting that, if the charges were true, “Mr. Trump should be furious at his ex-adviser for turning his signature issue into a grift.”But the pardon also left three other men who were indicted with Mr. Bannon in an unusual and unenviable predicament. None of them received pardons and so they still must face a trial in May. What’s more, legal experts said, Mr. Bannon could now be called as a government witness to testify against them, potentially increasing their legal jeopardy.John S. Martin Jr., a retired federal judge and former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said that, assuming Mr. Bannon accepted his pardon and the immunity it conferred, he could not invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called to testify for the government against his co-defendants.“He may not have walked as far away as he thought,” Mr. Martin said.Even if a judge allows Mr. Bannon to invoke the Fifth Amendment on the theory he still faces possible state charges, as some experts suggest, his absence at the defense table would doubtless reshape the trial.Mr. Bannon’s three co-defendants — Brian Kolfage, an Air Force veteran who lost both of his legs and one of his arms during his service in Iraq; Andrew Badolato, a venture capitalist; and Timothy Shea — will be left defending themselves without the most prominent figure in the alleged scheme.“Now, it’s a totally different trial,” said John C. Meringolo, Mr. Shea’s lawyer. “Different strategies must apply.”Philip Allen Lacovara, a former deputy solicitor general of the United States and onetime counsel to the Watergate special prosecutor, said Mr. Bannon’s former co-defendants might feel resentment at being “left holding the bag that he was helping to fill.”The three co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty, as did Mr. Bannon. Although Mr. Bannon will not be a defendant in the trial, testimony could link him to the fraud scheme, and defense lawyers for the other men may try to deflect suspicion and guilt away from their clients and in his direction.“They can point to what we call the empty chair,” said Benjamin Brafman, a leading criminal defense lawyer.Mr. Bannon’s lawyer, Robert J. Costello, said, “Mr. Bannon is not going to comment on the pardon or any speculation about events that have not happened.”Mr. Bannon had been an architect of Mr. Trump’s 2016 general election campaign and emerged as one of the most powerful figures in the White House early in the Trump administration before stepping down in August 2017. In announcing Mr. Bannon’s pardon, the White House called him “an important leader in the conservative movement” who is “known for his political acumen.”The indictment unsealed in August said Mr. Bannon and his three co-defendants had used the popularity among conservatives of Mr. Trump’s plan to seal the southern border to dupe donors to the private fund-raising effort called We Build the Wall.The organization had collected more than $25 million and had promised that all donations would go to the project, according to the indictment. The men were accused of using the money to pay for hotel and travel bills, credit card debt and other personal expenses.Mr. Trump is widely believed to have pardoned Mr. Bannon as a protective measure, to maintain his loyalty at a time when the former president faces multiple lawsuits and investigations.But Rachel E. Barkow, a New York University law professor and an expert on clemency issues, questioned the strategy of singling out Mr. Bannon for clemency among the four defendants.“Even if you wanted to reward Bannon,” she said, “it was really kind of a strange choice.”By allowing a trial to go forward against the three others, she said, the evidence still is likely to implicate Mr. Bannon in an alleged scheme that bilked hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters.“You would want to pardon all of them so that the trial doesn’t go forward,” Professor Barkow said. “To the extent the evidence shows that they were all inextricably linked and in it together, that pardon is going to look worse and worse.”One way the co-defendants might benefit from Mr. Bannon’s pardon would be at sentencing, should they be convicted. Each faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the two conspiracy charges in the indictment — to commit money laundering and wire fraud.But with Mr. Bannon walking free, their lawyers can point to federal guidelines that advise judges to avoid unwarranted disparities in sentences, said Sean Hecker, a white-collar defense lawyer.“What could be more unwarranted than one defendant in a criminal case, indeed, the most powerful of the four, being given a complete pass because of his relationship with the president?” Mr. Hecker said. “How, as a judge, do you get comfortable around the idea of imprisoning the remaining co-conspirators because the president left them hanging?”Mr. Bannon’s case is not the only one in which Mr. Trump used his clemency power on behalf of allies and supporters while leaving behind other less-connected defendants who were facing similar charges.On Dec. 22, for instance, he granted pardons to four security guards for Blackwater, a private company, who were convicted — one was serving a life sentence — on charges related to the 2007 massacre of 17 Iraqi civilians. A fifth former guard, Jeremy Ridgeway, who pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors, was not pardoned.“Once the president pardoned those guys, how can he not pardon me,” Mr. Ridgeway told The Los Angeles Times recently. “I accepted responsibility. I did the right thing. I testified. This is a matter of principle.”On the same day, Mr. Trump also pardoned two former Republican congressmen who were his ardent supporters — Chris Collins of New York and Duncan D. Hunter of California.Mr. Collins had pleaded guilty in 2019 to giving his son, Cameron Collins, inside information in advance about a failed drug trial, allowing his son to avoid hundreds of thousands of dollars in financial losses. Mr. Hunter had admitted in court that he misused more than $150,000 in campaign funds to support a lavish lifestyle.But Mr. Trump did not pardon Mr. Collins’s son, who also had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation. Cameron Collins’s lawyer, Rebecca Ricigliano, declined to comment on the case.Nor did the president immediately pardon Mr. Hunter’s wife, Margaret Hunter, who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the case and assisted the government.It was only a day later, after Ms. Hunter’s absence from the pardon list drew criticism from local leaders and from a former assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego who helped prosecute the case, that the White House announced Ms. Hunter had been given a presidential pardon. Her lawyer, Logan Smith, said in a statement at the time that his client “accepts this unexpected pardon with gratitude and humility.”</body>

	<title>Biden Ends Military’s Transgender Ban, Part of Broad Discrimination Fight</title>
	<author>Michael D. Shear</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday reversed his predecessor’s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, moving swiftly on a social issue as he broadly exerted the power of his office to prohibit discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.With Lloyd J. Austin III, his new secretary of defense, and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, beside him in the Oval Office, Mr. Biden signed an executive order restoring protections put in place in 2016 by President Barack Obama that had opened up the ranks of the armed services to transgender people.“What I’m doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform,” he said from behind the Resolute Desk moments before putting his signature on the document.The president’s action came less than a week after Mr. Biden began his presidency with another wide-ranging civil rights executive order directing the government to implement protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the United States based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County this past summer.That order revoked efforts by President Donald J. Trump to narrowly interpret that case. Instead, Mr. Biden’s administration will require all federal agencies to expand their understanding of the court’s ruling to protect L.G.B.T. people from discrimination in numerous areas, including housing, education, employment and health care.The swiftness of the president’s move on transgender troops signaled a willingness by the new Biden administration to put its own stamp on Defense Department social issues. It follows an announcement from Mr. Austin on Saturday that he was ordering a review of how the Pentagon has been handling sexual assault issues.Mr. Biden and the Defense Department leadership will also have to wrestle with a reckoning on race facing the Pentagon, which has long struggled to promote officers of color and only now has its first Black defense secretary in Mr. Austin. It also has a history of downplaying white nationalism in its ranks, an issue it is making new moves to address as it confronts a stark fact: Close to one in five of the protesters arrested in connection with the breaching of the Capitol on Jan. 6 — many of them with links to white supremacist organizations — have ties to the American military.Advocates for L.G.B.T. people praised Mr. Biden’s early efforts to reverse Trump administration policies, including ending the ban on transgender service in the military, and to shift American policy on the treatment of people who have historically been the subject of discrimination.“This level of engagement is a pivotal moment for the movement for justice and a marked shift from the previous president,” said Alphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest L.G.B.T. rights group. “President Biden has met the moment and proven himself a leader aiming to change and improve our nation’s culture.”Critics of Mr. Biden’s actions were quick to denounce the reversal of the ban on Monday.“Another ‘unifying’ move by the new Administration?” Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said in a Twitter post in which he linked to news reports on the executive order.The lifting of the transgender ban could come under fire in Congress — as it did in 2017 before Mr. Trump reinstated it. At that time, leading Christian conservative groups pressed the president and Republican lawmakers not to spend federal money on transgender medical costs. Others have argued that allowing transgender troops could harm morale or combat readiness. There are no official numbers for transgender troops, but researchers have estimated that it is in the low thousands.The Pentagon position on L.G.B.T. issues has evolved over time. Openly gay Americans were not allowed to serve until 2011, when Mr. Obama ended the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy put in place by the Clinton administration in 1993.Mr. Biden has long embraced a more expansive view of gay and transgender rights than some in his party. In 2012, his public declaration of support for same-sex marriage helped push Mr. Obama to take that position. During the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden vowed that, if elected, he would quickly roll back Mr. Trump’s restrictions on such rights.A Gallup poll taken in the summer of 2019, after Mr. Trump banned transgender service in the military, showed that 71 percent of all Americans disagreed with that action. But among Republicans, a slight majority supported keeping transgender people out of the military.But fulfilling that promise does not come without political risk for the new president and his party, which has only narrow majorities in the House and Senate.An aggressive push by the White House to empower and defend transgender people could undermine the re-election prospects for Democrats in conservative districts or states, where support for such policies is lower than it is nationally.The executive order Mr. Biden signed on Inauguration Day will push the federal government further into the issue than ever before. In addition to prohibiting employment discrimination against transgender people, the new rules will direct agencies to crack down on discrimination in K-12 schools, universities and vocational programs.The rules also prohibit someone from being refused a rental property because they are transgender, and will require federally funded health facilities to treat transgender people in the same manner that they do others. A transgender person cannot be denied credit because of that status under the new rules.The White House announced the end to the ban on military service as Mr. Biden met in the Oval Office with Mr. Austin and General Milley. It was Mr. Biden’s first meeting with his senior Defense Department leadership since his inauguration.Under the new rules, transgender people who are qualified to serve must be allowed to enlist. The order directs the military services to immediately begin identifying the records of transgender troops who had been discharged or denied re-enlistment on the basis of gender identity; their military records will be corrected, officials said.“Simply put, transgender service members will no longer be subject to the possibility of discharge or separation on the basis of gender identity,” a statement released by the White House on Monday said. It said that transgender service members would be able to “serve in their gender when transition is complete” and that their gender would be recorded in the Pentagon’s reporting system.“Transgender service members should know that they are accepted throughout the U.S. military,” the statement said.The move was expected, as Mr. Biden had indicated in November that he would work to restore Obama-era protections for transgender people.At the Pentagon, officials said they welcomed the action, and indicated that the department would begin implementing it quickly. “The department will immediately take appropriate policy action to ensure individuals who identify as transgender are eligible to enter and serve in their self-identified gender,” Mr. Austin said in a statement. “No one will be separated or discharged, or denied re-enlistment, solely on the basis of gender identity.”Mr. Austin said Mr. Biden’s executive order would “ensure all medically necessary transition-related care authorized by law is available to all service members,” which would remove a big stumbling block to transgender men and women seeking to join, or remain in, the military. He also promised to re-examine the cases of all transgender service members who are currently being forced out of the military.Senior military leaders, for their part, reacted on Monday with some relief that the Pentagon would not have to continue defending the contentious ban — which spawned a number of lawsuits around the country — in courts. While military officials have declined to speak publicly about the issue for fear of wading into politics, General Milley said during his confirmation hearing in 2019, when asked about the transgender issue, that “I do not believe there is anything inherent in anyone’s identity to prevent them from serving in the military.”Advocacy groups who had been fighting the ban since it was announced three years ago — in a tweet from Mr. Trump — have argued that the Pentagon did not need to spend months studying how to allow transgender people to serve because it had already done so. One such group, the Palm Center, said in a policy memo last summer that the military could reopen to transgender people rapidly if ordered to do so.“A big ship can take time to turn around, so often the Pentagon needs to study policy changes and move cautiously,” Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, said in an interview in July. “But this is the rare case where, since the military left inclusive policy for already-serving transgender personnel in place even as it implemented its ban, the switch is just waiting to be flipped.”Others argued that it was Mr. Trump’s ban, not Mr. Biden’s reversal of it, that had been ill-considered.“Every American with the skills and qualifications who meets the high standards to serve in our military deserves that opportunity. And every service member deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,” Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement Monday. “Donald Trump’s efforts to restrict service by transgender persons wasn’t rooted in facts or sound personnel policy. It was driven by politics, not national security.”</body>

	<title>Five Past Vaccine Drives and How They Worked</title>
	<author>Jenny Gross</author>
	<body>Scientists developed vaccines less than a year after Covid-19 was identified, a reflection of remarkable progress in vaccine technology. But progress in vaccine distribution is another story.Many questions that arose in vaccine rollouts decades ago are still debated today. How should the local and federal authorities coordinate? Who should get vaccinated first? What should officials do about resistance in communities? Should the hardest-hit places be prioritized? Who should pay?Some answers can be found in the successes and failures of vaccine drives over the past two centuries.In 1796, once the scientist Edward Jenner discovered that people infected with cowpox became immune to smallpox, doctors went from town to town in England, deliberately spreading cowpox by scratching infected material into people’s arms.The rollout worked on a local level, but how could it be distributed to people in faraway places, like in the Americas, where smallpox had devastated populations? In 1803, the Spanish government put 22 orphans on a ship to its territories in South America. The lead doctor, Francisco Xavier de Balmis, and his team injected cowpox into two of the boys, and then, once cowpox sores developed, took material from the sores and scratched it into the arms of two more boys.By the time the team arrived in the Americas, only one boy was still infected, but that was enough. Vaccine distribution in the Spanish territories was unsystematic, but eventually, members of the Spanish expedition worked with local political, religious and medical authorities to establish vaccination clinics. More than 100,000 people in Mexico received free vaccinations by 1805, according to a journal article, “The World’s First Immunization Campaign,” in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine.By the 20th century, when scientists had determined how to store and mass produce the smallpox vaccine, outbreaks had generally been contained.But an outbreak in 1947 in New York City, just before an Easter Sunday parade on a warm weekend, posed a major problem. The city’s health commissioner at the time, Israel Weinstein, called for everyone to get vaccinated, even if they had received the vaccination as children. Posters across the city warned: “Be Sure. Be Safe. Get Vaccinated!”The rollout was swift and well orchestrated. Volunteers and professional health care providers went to schools, delivering vaccines to students. At the time, the public had strong faith in the medical community, and the modern anti-vaccination movement barely existed. In less than a month, more than six million New Yorkers were vaccinated, and the city ended up recording only 12 infections and two deaths.On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government licensed the first vaccine against poliomyelitis, created by Dr. Jonas Salk, after scientists announced that day that it was found to be 80 percent to 90 percent effective.The next day, The New York Times reported in a front-page headline: “Supply to be low for time, but output will be rushed.”State and local health officials were in charge of the rollout to children, who were most at risk of contracting the disease.“Young, African-American kids were getting hit, but they were not at the top of the priority list because of the social conditions at the time,” said Dr. René F. Najera, editor of the History of Vaccines project at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Noting that it was difficult for parents in working-class jobs to take off time to stand in line with children at clinics, Dr. Najera said, “You see this over and over again, history kind of repeats itself.”Shortly after the rollout began, the program was suspended after reports that children had contracted polio in the arms where they received the vaccination, rather than the legs, which was more typical of the disease.More than 250 cases of polio were attributed to faulty vaccines, caused by a manufacturing error by one of the drugmakers involved in the effort, Cutter Laboratories, based in California, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The so-called Cutter Incident led to stronger regulatory requirements, and the vaccine rollout continued in the fall of 1955. The vaccine prevented thousands of cases of crippling illness, saved lives and ultimately ended the yearly threat of epidemics in the United States.“The possibility was raised today that the virus that caused the greatest world epidemic of influenza in modern history — the pandemic of 1918-19 — may have returned,” The Times reported on Feb. 20, 1976.An Army private in Fort Dix, N.J., had died from a type of swine flu that was genetically similar to the virus that caused the deadly influenza outbreak starting in 1918. President Gerald Ford acted quickly, and Congress purchased 200 million doses of vaccines to be distributed at no cost through state health agencies.But the campaign got off to a difficult start, after several people died soon after receiving shots at the same clinic in Pittsburgh. Two months later, reports emerged that some vaccine recipients developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological condition in which the body’s immune system attacks the nerves. Vaccinations were halted.In the end, the virus was not detected outside Fort Dix, and the Army private turned out to be the only known death from the virus.The H1N1 influenza virus, which originated in Mexico and was also known as the swine flu, struck in spring 2009, not in typical flu season.By late summer it was clear that the virus caused fewer deaths than many seasonal flu strains, and that some of the early reports from Mexico had been exaggerated. That was one of the big reasons that a lot of Americans avoided the flu vaccine when it was ready in the fall. It wasn’t just the anti-vaccination movement, though that was a factor.The H1N1 virus was tough on children and young adults and appeared to have a disproportionately high fatality rate among pregnant women. Because of these factors, the first groups to be vaccinated, after health care workers, were people with the highest risk of complications, pregnant women and children.The last group to be eligible for the vaccine were healthy people over 65, who were the least likely to contract it because they seemed to have had some resistance to it.Donald G. McNeil Jr. contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>The Trial of Donald Trump: The Sequel</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>To the Editor:Re “As Impeachment Trial Looms, G.O.P. Rift Is on Display” (news article, Jan. 25):Once again it appears that Republicans are willing to shoot themselves in the foot as they slink away from their duty to convict Donald Trump when the trial begins in two weeks. Keep in mind, this was no ordinary crime. Donald Trump didn’t lie about sex in the Oval Office; he didn’t pay thugs to get information on his opponent and lie about it.No, what this man is being charged with is “incitement of insurrection.” There can be no more heinous crime committed by a commander in chief.Yet Republicans still hide in corners, afraid to do their duty. While privately many will admit that the seditious crimes committed by Mr. Trump are worthy of impeachment, in public they cower, pathetically terrified of his followers, afraid of their own shadows. Their one concern is power. Power for power’s sake.So, go for it you “lovers of freedom.” By your cowardly acts, you will further divide the Republican Party. By not banishing him into the Hall of Shame, you will tear yourselves apart by the next election.Rick LevinBlue Lake, Calif.To the Editor:Once again, my beloved Democratic Party is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Instead of focusing on the important issues, like Covid and the economy, it chose to allow Donald Trump the chance to again gain the spotlight. For him, all publicity, good or bad, is good. He should have been able to slink away into an ignominious night, and the country could have had the great pleasure of no longer hearing his name in every newscast and publication.The Democrats should have chosen to censure him in a bipartisan vote. Then he would have left his term in shame and President Biden would have had a less divided Congress to work with him on his appointments and proposals. Instead Mr. Trump will probably be acquitted by the Senate, and will claim a great victory, which could relaunch his political career, or at least further endear him to his base. What were the Democrats thinking?Stephen EingornLake Frederick, Va.To the Editor:Re “A Call for the Return to Civility, and Truth as a Guiding Light,” by David E. Sanger (news analysis, front page, Jan. 21):President Biden’s welcome call for civility, healing and unity does not negate holding Donald Trump and Republican lawbreakers accountable. In order to heal — from terror inflicted on Americans witnessing the insurrection and trauma of lawmakers directly threatened — inciters, colluders, abettors and domestic terrorists must be prosecuted for their actions.Without assurance that laws matter and no one is above the law, we cannot collectively reach closure and regain faith in our democracy. Mr. Trump fomented disbelief in the validity of our election and incited his followers to violence. More gravely, he refused to act — for hours as he watched the attack on TV — to stop the violence and order in the National Guard.Mr. Trump, and any accomplices in Congress and elsewhere, must be held accountable for these criminal, seditious acts. Senate conviction and legal prosecution would provide closure, and a path to healing and unity. Without accountability, we remain unmoored, volatile and raw.Lisa ShoglowWeston, Conn.To the Editor:Since the Republican defense team certainly won’t call Donald Trump as a witness at the Senate impeachment trial, the Democratic prosecutors should subpoena him. Now lacking presidential privilege, he could assert his Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to testify. Or he might follow his instincts and try to defend himself. That should be fun!Michael J.

	<title>Biden’s Treasury will seek to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, an effort the Trump administration halted.</title>
	<author>Alan Rappeport</author>
	<body>President Biden’s Treasury Department is studying ways to speed up the process of adding Harriet Tubman’s portrait to the front of the $20 bill after the Trump administration allowed the Obama-era initiative to lapse, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Monday.The decision to have Ms. Tubman replace Andrew Jackson as the face of the $20 note was set in motion in 2016 by the Treasury secretary at the time, Jacob Lew. President Donald J. Trump opposed the idea, and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, stopped work on that part of the currency redesign, arguing that adding new security features to the money was a more urgent priority. Mr. Mnuchin said that notes with new imagery could not be put into circulation until 2028 and that a future Treasury secretary would make the call whether to replace Jackson.The Treasury Department, which Mr. Biden has nominated Janet L. Yellen to lead, plans to accelerate that timeline.“The Treasury Department is taking steps to resume efforts to put Harriet Tubman on the front of the new $20 notes,” Ms. Psaki said. “It’s important that our money reflect the history and diversity of our country.”A Treasury spokeswoman said that she had no information to share on when a new design of the $20 bill might be released.Mr. Trump professed to be a fan of Andrew Jackson, a fellow populist, and was a fierce opponent of altering historical images and statues.Mr. Mnuchin’s decision to slow-walk the change drew backlash from some Democrats in Congress and triggered a probe from the Treasury inspector general about whether the process faced improper political interference. The inquiry found no wrongdoing by Mr. Mnuchin.Under Mr. Lew’s plan, the new design was supposed to be unveiled in 2020 on the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.Preliminary designs of the note that were obtained by The New York Times revealed that — before Mr. Trump took office — conceptual work on a bill bearing Tubman’s likeness on the front and a statue of Jackson on the back was already underway.</body>

	<title>Tae Keller Wins Newbery Medal for ‘When You Trap a Tiger’</title>
	<author>Elizabeth A. Harris</author>
	<body>The American Library Association announced two of the country’s most prestigious prizes for children’s books on Monday: the Newbery Medal, which went to Tae Keller for “When You Trap a Tiger,” and the Caldecott Medal, an award for picture books, for “We Are Water Protectors,” illustrated by Michaela Goade.“When You Trap a Tiger,” published by Random House Children’s Books, follows a biracial girl named Lily whose family moves in with her ailing grandmother. A magical tiger appears, a figure from her grandmother’s Korean folk tales, and offers Lily a deal in exchange for restoring her grandmother to health.Keller, who grew up in Hawaii and, like Lily, is biracial, previously wrote the 2018 children’s book “The Science of Breakable Things.” The Newbery recognizes the year’s “most outstanding contribution to children’s literature.”“We Are Water Protectors” was written by Carole Lindstrom and published by Roaring Brook Press, a division of Holtzbrinck Publishing. Goade, the illustrator, uses billowing watercolors and floral patterns in the book, whose main character, an Ojibwe girl, joins with other Indigenous people to fight the Dakota Access Pipeline.Goade, who won the American Indian Youth Literature Award for Best Picture Book for “Shanyaak’utlaax: Salmon Boy” in 2018, is an enrolled member of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska.The John Newbery and Randolph Caldecott Medals were announced at the American Library Association midwinter meeting, which was held virtually this year.The organization announced other major prizes on Monday, including awards named for Coretta Scott King recognizing an African-American author and illustrator for outstanding work.The illustrator award went to Frank Morrison for “R-E-S-P-E-C-T: Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul.” It was written by Carole Boston Weatherford and published by Atheneum Books for Young Readers, a Simon and Schuster Children’s Publishing Division imprint.The author award went to Jacqueline Woodson for “Before the Ever After,” published by Nancy Paulsen Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House. Woodson has won several major awards in recent years, including a 2020 MacArthur “genius” grant, the National Book Award for young people’s literature for “Brown Girl Dreaming,” and the Hans Christian Andersen Award, which is a lifetime achievement prize in children’s literature.In 2020, with many children stuck at home and not attending school in person, book sales for young people shot up. Print sales of juvenile fiction rose 11 percent compared with 2019, according to NPD BookScan, and juvenile nonfiction was up 23 percent. Print book sales overall climbed more than eight percent.Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

	<title>Mexicans Worry That Even Getting Covid Won’t Make Their Leader Take It Seriously</title>

	<body>MEXICO CITY — A day after the news that Mexico’s president had contracted Covid-19, frustration rippled through the line of Mexicans anxiously waiting Monday to refill tanks of oxygen for relatives who were suffering from the same illness and gasping for air at home. For nearly a year, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had minimized the pandemic, claiming that religious amulets protected him, refusing to wear masks and even drinking from the same clay pot as supporters. It was only a matter of time until he got sick himself, some Mexicans said.With the president now infected, what most aggrieved many Mexicans was not only that he had flouted basic safety precautions, but that he also may go back to playing down the threat that the surging pandemic poses after his own illness.They noted that with top-notch medical care delivered at his living quarters, the president may well recover. But their loved ones, on the other hand, will struggle to get the most basic care, whether a bed at an overflowing hospital or just the supplies like oxygen that might help them survive at home. “My dad believed him — he believed him that nothing would happen by not wearing a mask,” said Lilia Ramírez Díaz, who was making the second trip of the day to refill an oxygen tank for her diabetic father, battling Covid-19 at home.“They both got sick,” she said, but the president “doesn’t have to go around looking and begging for an oxygen tank.”A devastated Mexico is struggling to rein in the pandemic. Three days before the president disclosed his own infection on Sunday, the authorities announced more than 1,800 coronavirus deaths, breaking the record of single-day deaths set just days earlier.In Mexico City, hospitals are at 89 percent capacity, according to the most recent health ministry figures, while nationwide, the figure is 60 percent. Across the country, more than half of all hospitals beds with ventilators are full.So far, more than 1.7 million people have contracted the virus in Mexico and more than 150,000 people have died. That is the fourth-highest death toll in the world. And some experts believe the real toll may be far higher.Amid widespread mistrust of hospitals, many infected people choose to stay home — and often die there. The cause of death may not be listed as Covid-19. That, combined with the country’s low levels of testing, means the pandemic’s true toll is most likely far worse than the official one.While Mr. López Obrador said Sunday that his symptoms were mild and that he “remained positive,” doctors warned that the 67-year-old heart attack survivor was in a high risk category.And it remains to be seen if his own bout with the virus will change the Mexican leader’s attitude toward it.Mr. López Obrador is not the first world leader to fall ill with coronavirus.Early last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain famously persisted in shaking hands with Covid-19 patients only to be admitted to a hospital himself after contracting the disease.Mr. Johnson emerged from his health emergency experience sounding chastened, and with a new, intimate awareness of the virus’s danger. He went on to embrace mask wearing and lockdowns and other measures designed to help stem transmission.But in Mexico, some public health experts fear their leader will go more the way of former President Donald J. Trump, who beat the virus last year and then continued to play down the pandemic and undermine health officials’ recommendations.Several public health experts interviewed said they worried Mr. López Obrador might maintain his opposition to mask wearing, lockdowns and social distancing.And if Mr. López Obrador recovers and then points to his own experience to dismiss the danger, it may help worsen Mexico’s surge in cases, warned Laurie Ann Ximénez-Fyvie, the head of the molecular genetics laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.“If López Obrador comes out of this saying: ‘See? I’m an old person with high blood pressure, and see how well I did? Let’s get back to business as usual,’ then that could really push us over the edge,” Dr. Ximénez-Fyvie said. “People could drop their guard even further, be more reckless.“And the president has already done everything possible to make people drop their guard as it is.”With a fragmented and weak opposition, there is little robust resistance to Mr. López Obrador’s policy prescriptions. The ruling party, the National Regeneration Movement, was founded by Mr. López Obrador and he holds great sway over its officials, who are said to take off their masks when they’re around the president to avoid upsetting him.Even if Mr. López Obrador changes his message and urges citizens to take precautions, it may not work.“In Mexico it is very hard to impose closures now, because a lot of the economy is not formal,” said Dr. Alejandro Macias, an infectious-disease expert. “The government may regulate the formal economy, but that ends up increasing demand for the non-regulated, informal economy.”The government had hoped to secure enough vaccine doses to roll out an ambitious program to vaccinate most frontline health care workers by the end of February. But that program came to a standstill last week after Pfizer said it could no longer meet its promise to distribute 1.5 million doses to Mexico. By Monday night, slightly more than 640,000 doses had been administered across the country.On Monday, Mexican officials spoke with their Russian counterparts to secure 24 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, but health experts caution that the Russian vaccine’s efficacy and safety cannot be guaranteed.“Mexico has been flying blind throughout this pandemic,” said Dr. Ximénez-Fyvie. “And now we are flying blind with the vaccine.”</body>

	<title>Mike Lindell, the MyPillow C.E.O. and a Trump conspiracy advocate, is barred from Twitter.</title>
	<author>Glenn Thrush</author>
	<body>Twitter has permanently suspended MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell — one of President Trump’s most conspicuous remaining public defenders — for peddling debunked conspiracy theories about voter fraud in the 2020 elections.Mr. Lindell’s Twitter account, which had nearly 413,000 followers, was permanently suspended “due to repeated violations of our Civic Integrity Policy,” Lauren Alexander, a Twitter spokeswoman, said in an email.Mr. Trump’s own account was permanently closed earlier this month for much the same reason — setting off a chain of high-profile bans imposed amid concerns that Mr. Trump and his supporters would use the platform to incite more violence, like the storming of the Capitol earlier this month.After the Capitol attack, Twitter said it had updated its rules to more aggressively police false or misleading information about the presidential election. As part of that move, Twitter has moved to suspend the accounts of more than 70,000 people who have promoted content related to QAnon, a fringe pro-Trump group that the F.B.I. has labeled a domestic terrorist threat.Many of Mr. Trump’s most erstwhile defenders backed away from him in the days following the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, which was stoked by the former president’s fiery and false speech to supporters claiming massive voter fraud. Not Mr. Lindell.A few days after the riot, he visited Mr. Trump in the White House — where photographers captured images of his notes, which while only partly visible seemed to suggest the president impose “martial law if necessary” to remain in office.Dominion Voting Systems, the target of his unsubstantiated claims of massive, intentional voter fraud, threatened to sue Mr. Lindell last week, describing him as a leader of a “misinformation campaign” that has resulted in significant business losses and threats of violence against Dominion employees.On Monday, Dominion Voting Systems filed a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, claiming he had personally profited by using his attacks against the company to promote commercial sponsorships.Mr. Lindell, 59, filed a lawsuit of his own on Monday, suing the British tabloid The Daily Mail, over a recent report that he was having an extramarital affair, seeking $75,000 in damages.His high-profile defense of Mr. Trump has earned him a devoted following on the right, but might have significant implications for his business. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and several other chains have said they plan to stop selling MyPillow products.</body>

	<title>Four falsehoods Giuliani spread about Dominion.</title>
	<author>Nick Corasaniti</author>
	<body>Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine vendors in the United States, filed a defamation lawsuit against Rudolph W. Giuliani on Monday, accusing him of spreading a litany of falsehoods about the company in his efforts on behalf of former President Donald J. Trump to subvert the election.The lawsuit chronicles more than 50 inaccurate statements made by Mr. Giuliani in the weeks after the election, and issues a point-by-point rebuttal of each falsehood. Here are four of the most common false statements Mr. Giuliani made about Dominion Voting Systems.Mr. Giuliani regularly stated, falsely, that Dominion “really is a Venezuelan company” and that it “depends completely on the software of Smartmatic,” a company “developed in about 2004, 2005 to help Chavez steal elections.”As Dominion writes in its lawsuit: “Dominion was not founded in Venezuela to fix elections for Hugo Chávez. It was founded in 2002 in John Poulos’s basement in Toronto to help blind people vote on paper ballots.” The suit later adds that the headquarters for the company’s United States subsidiary are in Denver.Another often-repeated claim was that Dominion had programmed its machines to flip votes: “In other words when you pressed down Biden, you got Trump, and when you pressed down Trump you got Biden.”This has been proved false by numerous government and law enforcement officials, including former Attorney General William P. Barr, who said in December: “There’s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud, and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the D.H.S. and D.O.J. have looked into that, and so far, we haven’t seen anything to substantiate that.”Similarly, a joint statement by numerous government and elections officials and agencies, including the National Association of State Election Directors, the National Association of Secretaries of State, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, stated that there was “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”The hand recount in Georgia also affirmed that the machine recounts were accurate in that state.Mr. Giuliani zeroed in on Antrim County, Mich., falsely claiming that a “Dominion machine flipped 6,000 votes from Trump to Biden” there, and that machines in the county were “62 percent inaccurate,” had a “68 percent error rate” and had an “81.9 percent rejection rate.”Mr. Giuliani’s focus on Antrim County stems from human errors made by the county clerk on election night. According to the lawsuit, the clerk “mistakenly failed to update all of the voting machines’ tabulator memory cards.” But the suit says that “her mistakes were promptly caught as part of the normal canvass process before the election result was made official.” The Michigan secretary of state’s office also conducted a hand audit of all presidential votes in Antrim County that found the machines were accurate.Mr. Giuliani claimed that his accusations, particularly in Antrim County, were backed up by experts. But he largely relied on one man, Russell Ramsland Jr., a former Republican congressional candidate from Texas, who, according to the lawsuit filed by Dominion, had also publicly favored false conspiracy theories.Dominion spent more than five pages on Mr. Ramsland’s lack of credentials to properly examine equipment, noting that he had a “fundamental misunderstanding of election software.” The suit also quotes the former acting director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Voting System Testing and Certification program, saying the report produced by Mr. Ramsland “showed a ‘grave misunderstanding’ of Antrim County’s voting system and ‘a lack of knowledge of election technology and process.’”</body>

	<title>Impeachment Briefing: The Senate Has It From Here</title>
	<author>Maggie Astor</author>
	<body>By Maggie AstorThis is the Impeachment Briefing, The Times’s newsletter about the impeachment investigation. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. At about 7 p.m., the House of Representatives delivered its article of impeachment against Donald J. Trump to the Senate, charging him with incitement of insurrection. This is a ceremonial and highly choreographed procedure in which the House impeachment managers physically carry the document across the Capitol.After walking the article through the halls that a mob ransacked just weeks ago, the lead impeachment manager — Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland — read it on the Senate floor. The article is four pages long, and reading it took about five minutes.The article states that when Mr. Trump addressed his supporters on Jan. 6, he “willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol.”It also notes his previous efforts to subvert the election results and says his actions “threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of government.”Officials confirmed that Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, would preside over the trial in his role as president pro tempore of the Senate. Normally, the chief justice of the United States presides over such trials, but the fact that Mr. Trump is no longer in office creates some wiggle room.If you’re finding it hard to believe it has been only 12 days since the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump, we can’t blame you. A lot has happened since then.The biggest thing that happened, of course, is that President Biden was inaugurated, lessening the practical implications of the impeachment trial. But the trial is still highly significant — both as a public signal of how much Republicans are willing to tolerate from a leader of their party, and because if the Senate were to convict Mr. Trump, it could vote to bar him from running again.Many Republican senators have argued that Mr. Trump’s departure makes impeachment a pointlessly divisive exercise, and if he is ultimately acquitted, it may be for that reason: The timing allows Republicans to take issue with procedure, rather than defending Mr. Trump’s actions.Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Democratic and Republican leaders, reached an agreement last week to delay the trial for two weeks, to allow time both for Mr. Trump’s lawyers to prepare their defense and for the Senate to work on confirming more of Mr. Biden’s cabinet nominees.Impeachment is now officially in the Senate’s hands, but the trial won’t start until Feb. 9. We talked to Nicholas Fandos, one of The Times’s congressional reporters, about what’s in store.What happens in the two weeks before the trial starts?On Tuesday, the Senate will convene as a court of impeachment for the first time so that senators can take an oath to administer “impartial justice” and issue a summons to Mr. Trump to answer the charge against him. But after that, the trial will essentially be put on pause until Feb. 9 to allow the prosecution and defense to draw up and submit a series of written briefs laying out their arguments. In the meantime, the Senate will go on working on confirmation of nominees to President Biden’s cabinet.Once the trial starts, can we expect it to run similarly to the last impeachment trial?We expect the substantive part of the trial to look roughly similar to the one last year, just on fast-forward. Each side will get to present its case, senators will have time to question them, and the chamber will vote on whether to call for additional witness testimony. That should all take place in just three or four days.If senators do want to hear from witnesses, that could increase the length of the trial by weeks. But if not, there could be a vote to convict or acquit Mr. Trump by the end of the week of Feb. 8.Are there open questions that you hope will be answered in the next two weeks?The two biggest questions right now are where Republicans will land on Mr. Trump’s guilt and whether they will want to hear from additional witnesses. Conceivably, any senators could announce their positions on those issues in the next two weeks, but my guess is that they will bite their tongue, bide their time and wait until February to make those calls.Two weeks before the impeachment trial begins, the Senate’s divisions are already hardening. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who cast the only Republican vote to convict Mr. Trump the first time he was impeached, seems prepared to do so again, while many other Republicans are bashing the decision to hold a trial at all.Representative Eric Swalwell of California, one of the House impeachment managers, appeared on MSNBC to argue for the constitutionality of holding a Senate trial against someone who is no longer president. He cited the 1876 impeachment trial of William Belknap, which was held after he had resigned as war secretary.The Impeachment Briefing is also available as a newsletter.

	<title>Twitter will test letting some users fact-check tweets.</title>
	<author>Kate Conger</author>
	<body>Twitter said on Monday it would allow some users to fact-check misleading tweets, the latest effort by the company to combat misinformation.Users who join the program, called Birdwatch, can add notes to rebut false or misleading posts and rate the reliability of the fact-checking annotations made by other users. Users in the United States who verify their email addresses and phone numbers with Twitter, and have not violated Twitter’s rules in recent months, can apply to join Birdwatch.Twitter will start Birdwatch as a small pilot program with 1,000 users, and the fact-checking they produce will not be visible on Twitter but will appear on a separate site. If the experiment is successful, Twitter plans to expand the program to more than 100,000 people in the coming months and will make their contributions visible to all users.Twitter continues to grapple with misinformation on the platform. In the months before the U.S. presidential election, Twitter added fact-check labels written by its own employees to tweets from prominent accounts, temporarily disabled its recommendation algorithm, and added more context to trending topics. Still, false claims about the coronavirus and elections have proliferated on Twitter despite the company’s efforts to remove them. But Twitter has also faced backlash from some users who have argued that the company removes too much information.Giving some control over moderation directly to users could help restore trust and allow the company to move more quickly to address false claims, Twitter said.“We apply labels and add context to tweets, but we don’t want to limit efforts to circumstances where something breaks our rules or receives widespread public attention,” Keith Coleman, a vice president of product at Twitter, wrote in a blog post announcing the program. “We also want to broaden the range of voices that are part of tackling this problem, and we believe a community-driven approach can help.”</body>

	<title>Tornado Strikes Alabama City, Killing at Least One</title>
	<author>Christine Hauser</author>
	<body>A tornado barreled through a northern suburb of Birmingham, Ala., late on Monday night, killing a teenager who had been sheltering in a basement with his family members when a tree fell on the house, the authorities said.The storm, which struck the city of Fultondale just before 11 p.m. local time, was part of a band of severe weather systems that extended across much of the Southeast, local meteorologists reported. It collapsed buildings, severely damaging a high school and a hotel, and trapped people in their homes.Bill Yates, the chief deputy coroner for Jefferson County, said Elliott Hernandez, 14, died Monday night in the basement of a single-family residence that collapsed during the tornado. His family members were rescued, Mr. Yates said in a statement.Jay Knight, a Jefferson County commissioner, said at a news conference on Tuesday that a tree fell on the house where the teenager and his family were taking shelter.The fire chief, Justin McKenzie, said up to 30 people had been injured, and 18 of them were taken to a hospital. He said at a news conference that rescuers conducted a second round of searches of homes in the daylight, and had found six people, including some who had been reported missing by their families.Speaking about the large number of tornadoes that take place in central Alabama, the fire chief said: “Sadly, here in Fultondale we are very experienced in these kind of things. We knew exactly what to do, how to do it and when to do it. We just don’t like to do it.”Nearly 4,000 tornadoes have struck Alabama and the surrounding region since 1989. The chief said in a telephone interview that humid air from the Gulf of Mexico colliding with cooler air from Canada and the Midwest give the central region the “high probability” of tornadoes.He said Monday’s storm started out as low risk and within “a matter of minutes” transformed into a tornado warning.“This area of central Alabama gets hit on a regular basis almost every year,” he said in the interview. “We are responding two to three times per season,” he added, during the spring and fall.A Hampton Inn off Interstate 65 in Fultondale was mangled by the tornado, which tore off part of the roof, photographs shared online showed.“We do still have people trapped in houses,” Larry Holcomb, the city’s mayor, said by telephone early Tuesday.Mr. Holcomb said that he had been at home when the tornado hit and that streets in his neighborhood were blocked by fallen trees.Workers from Alabama Power Company were trying to restore electricity to residences that had none.Mr. Knight said that most of the damage was in the city of Fultondale, but that the tornado skipped a few times, striking some parts of Center Point, which lies to the west.Michael Holloway, a resident of Fultondale, sat in his truck outside his house on Tuesday and waited for friends to bring chain saws to clear the fallen trees blocking his path.The windows of his house were blown out, and a backyard shed was gone, he told WBRC, a local TV station. His garage, he said, was “completely leveled.”High winds and heavy rain continued to move through the area affected by the tornado, hampering search-and-rescue efforts, according to local news reports.The northbound lanes of Interstate 65, the north-south highway that bisects the state, were closed after the tornado hit Fultondale because of a major crash, the Alabama Department of Transportation said. It was not immediately clear if the crash had been caused by the tornado or its aftermath.The National Weather Service in Birmingham said it would inspect the damage to determine the strength of the tornado.Daniel Victor contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Israel’s early vaccine data offers hope.</title>
	<author>Isabel Kershner</author>
	<body>Israel, which leads the world in vaccinating its population against the coronavirus, has produced some encouraging news: Early results show a significant drop in infection after just one shot of a two-dose vaccine, and better than expected results after both doses.Public health experts caution that the data, based on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, is preliminary and has not been subjected to clinical trials. Even so, Dr. Anat Ekka Zohar, the vice president of Maccabi Health Services, one of the Israeli health maintenance organizations that released the data, called it “very encouraging.”In the first early report, Clalit, Israel’s largest health fund, compared 200,000 people aged 60 or over who received a first dose of the vaccine to a matched group of 200,000 who had not been vaccinated yet. It said that 14 to 18 days after their shots, the partly vaccinated patients were 33 percent less likely to be infected.At about the same time, Maccabi’s research arm said it had found an even larger drop in infections after just one dose: a decrease of about 60 percent, 13 to 21 days after the first shot, in the first 430,000 people to receive it.Maccabi did not specify an age group or whether it had compared the data with a matched, non-vaccinated cohort.The Israeli Health Ministry and Maccabi released on Monday new data on people who had received both doses of the vaccine, showing extremely high rates of effectiveness.The ministry found that of 428,000 Israelis who had received their second doses, only 63, or 0.014 percent, had contracted the virus a week later. Similarly, the Maccabi data showed that more than a week after having received the second dose, only 20 of roughly 128,600 people, about 0.01 percent, had contracted the virus.In clinical trials, the Pfizer vaccine proved 95 percent effective after two doses in preventing coronavirus infection in people without evidence of previous infection. The Israeli results, if they hold up, suggest the efficacy could be even higher, though rigorous comparisons to unvaccinated people have not yet been published.Both Clalit and Maccabi warned that their findings were preliminary and said they would soon be followed by more in-depth statistical analysis in peer-reviewed scientific publications.Israel, where more than 40 percent of the population has already received one dose of the vaccine, has become something of an international test case for vaccination efficacy.</body>

	<title>Pentagon Accelerates Efforts to Root Out Far-Right Extremism in the Ranks</title>
	<author>Helene Cooper</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is intensifying efforts to identify and combat white supremacy and other far-right extremism in its ranks as federal investigators seek to determine how many military personnel and veterans joined the violent assault on the Capitol.In the days since a pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, senior leaders of the 2.1 million active-duty and reserve troops have been grappling with fears that former or current service members will be found among the horde.The F.B.I. investigation into the Capitol siege, still in its very early stages, has identified at least six suspects with military links out of the more than 100 people who have been taken into federal custody or the larger number still under investigation. They include a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel from Texas, an Army officer from North Carolina and an Army reservist from New Jersey. Another person with military service was shot and killed in the assault.The military’s examination of its ranks marks a new urgency for the Pentagon, which has a history of downplaying the rise of white nationalism and right-wing activism, even as Germany and other countries are finding a deep strain embedded in their armed forces.“These people are not representative of our country’s military,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview. He said most active-duty troops and veterans “continue to serve honorably and uphold their oath to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution.”For more than a week now, General Milley has listened to analysts, read reports and viewed videos of the riots. “There was some indication that an unknown number of veterans associated with the insurrection,” he said.General Milley said he saw rioters carrying military flags. At the rally and later at the Capitol breach, rioters were seen with Marine Corps flags, Army patches and Special Forces insignia.Federal officials are vetting thousands of National Guard troops arriving to help secure the inauguration. Of the 21,500 Guard personnel who had arrived in Washington by Monday, any who will be near President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will receive additional background checks, a standard procedure to counter insider threats that was also taken before President Trump’s inauguration in 2017.Defense Department officials say they are looking into stepping up the monitoring of social media postings from service members, in much the way companies do with their employees.Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed trying to climb through a door in the Capitol, was an Air Force veteran with a robust social media presence.Social media also led to arrests on Sunday of Donovan Crowl, 50, a former U.S. Marine, and Jessica Watkins, 38, an Army veteran. They both put up photos of themselves dressed in combat gear and saying they breached the Capitol.Federal agents said Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, the reservist from New Jersey, is a neo-Nazi and white supremacist; he also works — with secret clearance — at a naval weapons station.A federal prosecutor said Larry R. Brock, the retired Air Force officer, had intended to take hostages in the Capitol.Capt. Emily Rainey, an Army officer who told The Associated Press that she had transported 100 people to Washington for the Trump rally, is being investigated by the Army for any connection to the riots, according to a military official. Captain Rainey had resigned from her post last year but was not set to leave until this spring.General Milley said he saw reports that “people were showing their C.A.C. cards,” a reference to the identification cards used to enter military installations and the Pentagon.Last Tuesday, General Milley and the rest of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an extraordinary letter to all military personnel, reminding them that Mr. Biden would soon be their commander in chief and that they were duty bound to defend the Constitution.The Defense Department inspector general announced an investigation last week into the effectiveness of Pentagon policies and procedures that prohibited service members from advocacy of or participation in supremacist or extremist groups.The reckoning at the Pentagon comes as retired Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III is poised to become the nation’s first Black defense secretary, an ascension that, depending on how General Austin decides to proceed, could either sharpen or blur the American military’s decades-long battles with racial inequality and white supremacy.In his 41-year career in the Army before retiring as a four-star general in 2016, General Austin witnessed firsthand both the possibilities and the limitations of how the military deals with race. As an Army officer, he has told of how he had to confront troops with Nazi insignia at Fort Bragg, N.C., and of countless meetings when he was the only person of color in the room. Now, if he is confirmed as defense secretary, he will have to decide if he will confront the far-right politics that have heightened during four years under Mr. Trump.“This needs to be rooted out of our military,” Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and an Iraq war veteran, said in an interview last week. General Austin, she said, “will be in a unique position to head up that effort.”General Austin’s confirmation hearings begin on Tuesday, and lawmakers will most likely press him on how he plans to tackle extremism in the ranks.Pentagon officials have known for some time that they have a problem. The Defense Department routinely brags that the American military is a microcosm of American society — but officials now acknowledge that if a segment of American society holds white supremacist views, that means there will be a similar segment of the military that does, too.Last year, the F.B.I. notified the Defense Department that it had opened criminal investigations involving 143 current or former service members. Of those, 68 were related to domestic extremism cases, according to a senior Pentagon official. The “vast majority” involved retired military personnel, many with unfavorable discharge records, the official said.The majority of the domestic extremism cases involved antigovernment or anti-authority motivations, including attacks on government facilities and authorities, the official said. One-quarter of the cases were associated with white nationalism. A small number were associated with antifascist or anti-abortion motivations.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.The acting secretary of defense, Christopher C. Miller, directed Pentagon officials last month to toughen policies and regulations banning extremist activities among troops, and update the Uniform Code of Military Justice to specifically address extremist threats.“We in the Department of Defense are doing everything we can to eliminate extremism,” Garry Reid, the Pentagon’s director for defense intelligence, told reporters last week. Mr. Reid, however, was unable to outline specifics and declined to address any aspect of active duty members’ participation at the Capitol.Rising concerns about right-wing activism in the armed forces are not concentrated only in the United States. In Germany, security services counted more than 1,400 cases of suspected far-right extremism among soldiers, police officers and intelligence agents in the three years ending in March, according to a government report released in the fall.The United States military, unlike police departments and other law enforcement groups, has the ability to use extremist beliefs to disqualify those seeking to join. But, critics note, it has repeatedly failed to broadly apply those mandates.“The military has unique abilities to set boundaries on conduct that other parts of government don’t have,” said Katrina Mulligan, the managing director of national security and international policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. “But they have been unevenly applied.”Military officials and independent specialists say General Austin will face a daunting challenge. Pentagon officials concede that despite the checks in place, white supremacist and other far-right groups actively recruit service members or have their own members try to join the military to learn skills and expertise, which also lends legitimacy to their cause.All military personnel, including those in the National Guard, undergo extensive background investigations and physical examinations including assessments of tattoos. Troops are continuously monitored for indications that they are involved in extremist activity and receive training to identify others around them who could be “insider threats.”But critics say the military’s leadership has often failed to hold violators accountable consistently.“Current regulations have penalties that are largely left up to commanders, often at the unit level,” Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told a House hearing last February. “There appears to be no process to track people expelled for ties to white supremacists’ groups.”At the same time, there are many internal cultural issues within the military — from the recruitment process to training and beyond — that may take years to unravel.The recently approved National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2021, which sets annual Pentagon policy and spending priorities, contained measures meant to help the department address the issue, including a new position in the Defense Department inspector general’s office: a deputy inspector general for diversity and inclusion and supremacist, extremism and criminal gang activity. Congress also charged the inspector general with establishing a “mechanism to track and report” extremist or gang activity in the military.</body>

	<title>‘Margaret,’ ‘American Animals’ and More Streaming Alternatives</title>
	<author>Jason Bailey</author>
	<body>As we settle in for a few more months of homebound entertainment, you may find those once-abundant watch lists getting shorter and more barren, so it’s time to take a few more chances. This month’s roundup of under-the-radar streaming suggestions includes bloodcurdling horror, kooky (and sometimes cringe-inducing) comedy, and thoughtful nonfiction takes on flashy subjects.Stream it on Amazon and Hulu.Occasionally, a smart filmmaker will announce they’re going to make a “dark” fairy tale, and the results are usually akin to a “gritty” superhero reboot: skin deep and carefully audience-friendly. So the director Osgood Perkins (“The Blackcoat’s Daughter”) deserves credit for crafting a deeply creepy exploration of real terror and real peril with “Gretel &amp; Hansel,” tapping into the vein of true darkness at the heart of the Brothers Grimm’s classic. As before, the title characters are brother and sister who stumble into the clutches of an evil witch — but this witch (as played by Alice Krige) is a witch, genuinely bloodthirsty and scary, with blood-red clouds billowing from her cottage chimney. “Gretel &amp; Hansel” is a disturbing slab of Gothic horror, filled to the brim with nightmare imagery and pitch-black humor, and decidedly not meant for the kids.Stream it on Netflix.Before Marvel tossed the “Spider-Man” franchise keys to the director Jon Watts, he helmed this comparatively microbudget, small-scale thriller, in which two boys take an abandoned police cruiser on a joy ride, and discover a whole world of trouble. Much of it comes in the form of Kevin Bacon, in a solid character turn as the bad cop who left the vehicle unattended, and quickly realizes these two kids are a troublesome loose end. Watts keeps things lean and mean, embracing the story’s B-movie sensibilities and coming up with a pulpy exercise that legitimately recalls Steven Spielberg’s debut feature, “Duel.”Stream it on Hulu.In 2012, Bart Layton directed “The Imposter,” one of the more compelling true-crime documentaries of the era. For this follow-up, he tells another true story, but through a more complicated lens. The tale in question concerns a quartet of students who attempted to rob the rare-book room of their college library, which they recall in narration and interviews that coincide and clash in fascinating ways — but Layton also dramatizes their story with four flashy young actors, creating a documentary/narrative hybrid that not only amps up the surface thrills of the heist, but asks pointed questions about the inherent glamorization and exploitation of films like these.Stream it on HBO Max.“I’m in sort of a limbo right now,” explains Kate (Gillian Jacobs, wonderful), and that’s putting it mildly: Her debut novel isn’t selling, her publisher just canceled her book tour and her ex-fiancée is already in another relationship. So the invitation from her former professor (Jemaine Clement) to do a reading at her alma mater isn’t just a promotional opportunity — it’s a lifeline, a chance to recall when her life seemed full of opportunities rather than failures. The writer and director Kris Rey expertly walks a tightrope of quiet tragedy and cringe comedy, and Jacobs wears Kate’s tics and insecurities not as flaws, but as deeply relatable merit badges.Stream it on Netflix.It’s easy to imagine a romantic comedy set in the world of health clubs and personal trainers as blandly formulaic studio junk (imagine, say, Matthew McConaughey and Katherine Heigl in the leads, circa 2006). But the writer and director Andrew Bujalski (“Computer Chess,” “Support the Girls”) is a true original, and he scrambles the tropes of the genre — odd couples, a love triangle, unrequited crushes — through his own deeply weird sensibilities. Cobie Smulders and Guy Pearce are terrific in the leading roles of type-A trainers who funnel their sexual tension into their work, but the ace character actor Kevin Corrigan (“Goodfellas”) steals the show as the rich, eccentric client who turns their situation inside out.Stream it on Hulu.Once upon a time, “naughty nuns” would have been the quickie description for a leering exploitation movie; these days, it’s the hook for this quirky period comedy from the writer and director Jeff Baena. Drawing inspiration from Giovanni Boccaccio’s “The Decameron,” Baena focuses on a trio of nuns (Aubrey Plaza, Alison Brie and Kate Micucci) whose long-stifled desires are unlocked by the arrival of the convent’s hunky new handyman (Dave Franco). Monty Python-esque sex and silliness abound, with additional laughs provided by a stacked supporting cast that includes Molly Shannon, John C. Reilly, Fred Armisen, Nick Offerman, Adam Pally, Jemima Kirke and Paul Reiser.Stream it on Netflix.Some actors seem born out of their proper time, and it’s a shame that Michael Shannon arrived decades after the glory days of film noir, as few contemporary actors are so gifted at putting across the complex mixture of duty and desire required by a noir leading man. But this neo-noir thriller is the next best thing, pairing Shannon and the great Imogen Poots in what seems a standard sap/femme fatale face-off — until the writer and director Matthew Ross digs out the humanity and complexity beneath those well-established types.Stream it on HBO Max.The battle to get Kenneth Lonergan’s sophomore feature released was nearly as dramatic as the events onscreen, culminating in a protracted battle over final cut that put the picture in theaters years after its completion. Both the theatrical version and Lonergan’s longer cut are streaming on HBO Max, for your own comparison and contrast; even in its shortened version, this is a powerful drama of impotent rage and survivor’s remorse, capturing the mood of New York City (and the nation) in the years after 9/11. The movie is boosted by a stunning central performance from Anna Paquin and a stellar bit of pre-“Succession” work by J. Smith-Cameron.Stream it on Amazon.It’s hard to imagine a modern-day N.F.L. cheerleading squad affecting popular culture as fully as the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders did in the late 1970s and early 1980s — because their far-reaching fame was so tied to that specific moment in the evolution of sexual mores, and the backlash to it was so rooted in the shifts in the feminist movement. The director Dana Adam Shapiro grapples with those contradictions in compelling fashion, transforming subject matter that could have been the target for snickering into a razor-sharp examination of a culture in flux.</body>

	<title>How Nan Whaley, Dayton’s Mayor, Sees Ohio Politics and Portman’s Senate Seat</title>
	<author>Alexander Burns</author>
	<body>Senator Rob Portman’s announcement on Monday that he would not seek a third term in 2022 sent a shock wave through Ohio politics and dealt a setback to national Republicans who were counting on Mr. Portman, 65, to easily keep his seat in G.O.P. hands next year. By the afternoon, a throng of ambitious Republicans were circling the race, including the far-right Representative Jim Jordan, as well as a few prominent Democrats.One of those Democrats was Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton. A 45-year-old progressive who campaigned for Pete Buttigieg in the 2020 presidential primaries, Ms. Whaley has long been seen as a likely candidate for governor or Senate. In 2019, she led her city through the aftermath of a mass shooting in which nine people were killed.Democrats in Ohio have seen the political tide turn hard against them over the past decade, and they have lost three races for governor, two out of four Senate campaigns and nearly every other statewide election, leaving Senator Sherrod Brown, 68, as a lonely Democrat holding high office there. Though Barack Obama won Ohio twice, Donald J. Trump carried it by eight percentage points in both 2016 and 2020.In an interview with The Times on Monday evening, Ms. Whaley confirmed her interest in being a candidate in 2022 and said President Biden must move swiftly to deliver economic relief to the people in her state. The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.What’s it going to take for Democrats to get back in the game statewide?We have all recognized, from the close governor’s race in ’18 and the tough presidential races, that we have to have an Ohio-specific message. So, regardless if it’s a federal race or a local race, there is a message like the message Sherrod Brown delivers that resonates very well in this state. It’s not necessarily being a moderate. It’s a message of being very real and talking about the issue that affects Ohioans the most, first — and that is the fact that for three decades, they have been working harder and harder and getting further behind.The true civil war in the Republican Party gives Democrats in this state a great opportunity.In a backward-looking way: Do you think Obama’s success in Ohio gave people an unrealistic sense of how purple it is, or do you think Trump’s strength there has given people an unrealistic sense of how red it is?I think it’s both, honestly. I think what people forget about Ohio is, it’s an economic populist state, and its economic populism is why Sherrod does so well here. When Trump was like, “$2,000 stimulus checks for everyone,” I was like, “Absolutely, I agree with Trump, that’s right.”What people want in Ohio — it’s not complicated. They want to work and they want to get paid decent for that work. It’s not rocket science. And over three decades, both parties have not been paying attention to that.I think ’22 gives us a real opportunity to localize some of these issues in Ohio.When you say “localize” — how much is that an admission that, look, the national brand and the national cultural orientation of the Democratic Party is just a big problem in Ohio?I am frustrated sometimes with the national messaging, and it’s not just the Democratic Party. Just, a lot of times, the elitism that comes off from the coasts. That’s a challenge.The Michigan Democratic message? That’s a good message for Ohio.How does that elitism translate in the political message of the party?It’s what we choose to talk about first.You know, I was on a call this week with John Kerry and Gina McCarthy about the work on climate change, which we all agree on. But the key, for us, if you look at what Bill Peduto has moved forward with mayors from Ohio and the Ohio River Valley, the Marshall Plan for Middle America — we have to bring these jobs to the middle of the country.It can’t just be, “This is great for the climate.” It’s also, “It’s a great job creator.” And that’s what we should lead with in these states.Are there things that national Democrats talk about that you feel like, it’s not even a question of emphasis or angle, but it needs to not be on the agenda — period?No, I don’t. I don’t think there’s anything like that. But I think what we lead with a lot of times comes off in a way that doesn’t resonate.One of the challenges in our party is, we have a lot of smart people in the party and everyone wants to be the smartest person in the room. And shouldn’t we be focused on what makes people’s lives better, even if it’s a regular person’s idea?Do you think Biden could have won the state?Yes, I do.What would it have taken?Not to be in Covid. We did no voter reg in the state. They [Republicans] did.And then we didn’t do any voter contact on the ground, and they did. I’m glad we saved lives, don’t get me wrong. But that affected our turnout in urban communities, it affected their turnout in rural communities. We did nothing.What do you think people in Ohio need to see from Biden in the next year, or even in the next three months, in order to ——They need the rescue package. They need to see that something is different, and it’s moving quickly. They need to see that they don’t have to worry every month on whether or not they’re going to get bailed out at the last minute on unemployment and eviction, even though it’s no fault of theirs that the pandemic happened to them, and that they happen to work on frontline jobs that people can’t go to now because the pandemic is raging. And that we’ve got their back.Do you think they care about legislation like that being bipartisan, or do you think they just want it fast?No. No. They want it fast. Nobody cares what happens in D.C. and who voted what. They just want it done, and we should provide that.Where is your head, about your options for 2022?We’re going to make the decision in the coming weeks. I’ve gotten a lot of encouragement today, with probably every Ohio Democrat giving me their opinion on what I should do, which has been really nice.Are both the governor’s race and the Senate race on the table?Yeah.Do you expect to be on the ballot, one way or the other?I hope so.If Jim Jordan decides to run [for Senate], it is highly likely he will win that primary. We recognize that the soul of our state is at stake, and that’s a motivation to all of us.What would your message be to a Democrat from outside Ohio — let’s say someone on the coast — who looks at the results from the last election and the results from Georgia this month, and says, “Why are we even bothering in these states where we’re getting our [rear ends] kicked when there are states that are moving our way?”I would say, there are four states that put Biden over, and they were won collectively by a little more than 100,000 votes. So, you ignore this, as a party, at your own peril. We won, decisively, the popular vote, but democracy is really at stake if we don’t pay attention to places like Ohio.You look at the Senate, you look at our long-term play, and we’ve still got a lot of work to do.</body>

	<title>What’s on TV This Week: ‘Snowpiercer’ and ‘Resident Alien’</title>
	<author>Gabe Cohn</author>
	<body>Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Jan. 25-Jan. 31. Details and times are subject to change.SNOWPIERCER 9 p.m. on TNT. Daveed Diggs and Jennifer Connelly star in this science-fiction thriller series, based on both Bong Joon Ho’s sci-fi film of the same name and on the series of French graphic-novels that inspired that film. All three share a biting social commentary and a post-apocalyptic setting: A train circling a frozen earth ravaged by a climate calamity, carrying a population of human survivors who are divided by class. The first season of the TV series introduced a former police detective (Diggs) and a member of the train’s bourgeois leadership, Melanie Cavill (Connelly), who holds a rare sympathy for the train’s lower-class inhabitants. The second season, debuting on Monday night, will reveal more about the train’s mysterious billionaire creator, played by Sean Bean. The show has unplanned echoes with real, present life — as Connelly pointed out in an interview with The New York Times in May of last year, when the first season debuted. “Everyone on that train has been separated from their communities, the lives that they lived, the places that they loved,” she said. “We didn’t imagine that, by time this show came out, we would all be living a version of that.” Going into the second season, that grave resonance remains.UNSTOPPABLE (2010) 5:30 p.m. on AMC. For a choo-choo experience with less social bite (but more wizz-banging) than “Snowpiercer,” consider “Unstoppable,” an action movie with Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. Directed by Tony Scott, the film casts Washington as a veteran railman who gets paired with a younger conductor (Pine). The plot follows the pair’s efforts to stop a runaway train filled with toxic cargo, which threatens to cause an environmental catastrophe should the train derail. Their mission makes for “nutty, kinetic entertainment,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. Scott, she wrote, “creates an unexpectedly rich world of chugging, rushing trains slicing across equally beautiful industrial and natural landscapes.”MIXED-ISH 9:30 p.m. on ABC. Kenya Barris’s sitcom “black-ish” got a neon jolt of 1980s flavor with “mixed-ish,” a prequel series that debuted in 2019. The prequel looks at the childhood of Rainbow (Arica Himmel), the character played by Tracee Ellis Ross in the main series, and her experience coming of age as a multiracial American teenager at that time. The second season kicks off on Tuesday night with the family discovering that Rainbow’s brother, Johan (Ethan William Childress), has been misrepresenting his race.FORD V FERRARI (2019) 9:05 p.m. on HBO2. This year, Ford is rolling out an electric Mustang crossover to rival Tesla, and Ferrari is preparing to release its first S.U.V. But in 1966, those two car manufacturers went toe-to-toe, pedal to the gas-guzzling metal at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France. This historical drama, directed by James Mangold, dramatizes that race and the events leading up to it from Ford’s perspective, centering on Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who work together to develop a car that can outpace their Italian rivals.RESIDENT ALIEN 10 p.m. on Syfy. Chris Sheridan, a longtime writer for “Family Guy,” is behind this sci-fi comedy, an adaptation of the Dark Horse comic series of the same name. The story follows Harry, an alien who crash-lands on earth and assumes the identity of a doctor in a small Colorado town. Human viewers of the show may realize that this alien doctor is actually Alan Tudyk, the shape-shifting actor who played the “Star Wars” droid K-2SO and the parrot Iago in 2019’s “Aladdin.”THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI (2017) 5:50 p.m. on FXM. Frances McDormand’s name is on the tongues of awards-season pundits this year for her role in “Nomadland,” a road drama from Chloé Zhao that’s due out next month on Hulu and in theaters. McDormand won an Academy Award a few years ago for her role in this dark crime dramedy written and directed by Martin McDonagh. She plays a Missouri mother seeking justice for her daughter’s murder — justice that she’s not getting from the town’s ailing police chief (Woody Harrelson) and a tempestuous deputy (Sam Rockwell). In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis took issue with McDonagh’s filmmaking, writing that his “bids at humor grow progressively less successful.” But she praised the performances, particularly McDormand, who she wrote “makes pain so palpably all-encompassing that you see it in her character’s every glance and gesture.”IN CONCERT AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). With in-person performances still on hiatus, the Hollywood Bowl recently started broadcasting collections of archival performances through the “In Concert at the Hollywood Bowl” program. The 9 p.m. broadcast on Friday features a performance from Dianne Reeves and a jazz jam session with Herbie Hancock, Carlos Santana, Wayne Shorter, Marcus Miller and Cindy Blackman Santana. It is followed at 10 p.m. by a second program built around show tunes. Performers in that segment include Audra McDonald and Kristin Chenoweth.BURDEN (2020) 9 p.m. on Showtime. Garrett Hedlund plays a South Carolina Klan member who renounces his ways thanks to the extreme kindness of a small-town preacher (Forest Whitaker) in this redemption drama. The film, which is based on a true story, “is often preachy and overripe with white-power symbolism,” Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. “Yet its mood of airless bigotry is quite effective, portraying the Klan’s influence with officials and the police as an ingrained stain on the fabric of the town.”LADY AND THE DALE 9 p.m. on HBO. In the 1970s, an ostensible entrepreneur named Elizabeth Carmichael began touting the Dale, a fuel-efficient, three-wheeled car that promised to be revolutionary. It turned out to be a sham. This new documentary mini-series revisits the case.</body>

	<title>Apollo C.E.O. to Step Down After Firm Finds More Payments to Jeffrey Epstein</title>
	<author>Katherine Rosman</author>
	<body>The founders of Apollo Global Management, one of the world’s biggest private equity firms, engaged in a brief power struggle this weekend over control of the firm, a rift that opened up after an inquiry revealed that one founder — Apollo’s chief executive and chairman, Leon Black — had paid more than $150 million to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.On Monday, Mr. Black announced his plan to step down as chief executive this year. “I have advised the Apollo board that I will retire as C.E.O. on or before my 70th birthday in July and remain as chairman,” he said in a statement.The review — ordered by the firm’s board at Mr. Black’s behest in October, after The New York Times detailed at least $75 million in payments — found that Mr. Black had paid Mr. Epstein $158 million in a five-year period ending in 2017. He had also lent Mr. Epstein more than $30 million, only $10 million of which was paid back, the report found.Mr. Black’s payments effectively bankrolled the lifestyle of Mr. Epstein — whom Mr. Black viewed as a “confirmed bachelor with eclectic tastes,” according to the report — in the years after his 2008 guilty plea in Florida to a prostitution charge involving a teenage girl.Also, Mr. Black believed that Mr. Epstein had “served his time” for that case and deserved a second chance, the report said. It found there was no evidence that Mr. Black had participated in any of Mr. Epstein’s criminal activities, or that Mr. Epstein had ever introduced Mr. Black to any underage girl.The details of their financial dealings — Mr. Epstein’s advice was worth perhaps $2 billion in tax savings to Mr. Black, according to the report — created friction between Mr. Black and one of Apollo’s other founders, Joshua Harris, according to three people briefed on the discussions. In recent months, Apollo investors had begun openly questioning the financial ties between Mr. Black and Mr. Epstein, who died in 2019. One of the people said Mr. Harris believed that Mr. Black showed poor judgment in consorting with Mr. Epstein, and that the new findings would further hurt Apollo’s reputation.Apollo’s board held a videoconference on Sunday to approve the findings of the review, according to two people briefed on the discussions. At the meeting, Mr. Black also announced his plans to step down this year and hand over the chief executive job to Marc Rowan, Apollo’s third founder. Mr. Black intends to remain chairman of the New York firm, which manages $455 billion for institutional investors, including pension plans and sovereign wealth funds.During a series of meetings on Sunday evening, including with individual board members, Mr. Harris raised objections to Mr. Black’s timeline for stepping down, believing that the reputational threat was so serious that Mr. Black should relinquish the chief executive role without delay, the people said. Mr. Harris also made his case to his co-founders that night in discussions with Apollo’s executive committee — which consists of the three of them.In the end, Mr. Harris’s objection fell on deaf ears, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private deliberations.Mr. Rowan, who built Apollo’s insurance business but had largely stepped away from the firm’s day-to-day operations in recent years, will take over when Mr. Black steps down.Mr. Black informed Apollo’s clients of the succession plan and the findings of the review in a letter on Monday evening.Mr. Harris will continue in his current role as a senior managing director, focused on the firm’s financial performance and working closely with Mr. Rowan, according to the letter, the contents of which were reviewed by The Times. The letter also informed clients of other proposed governance changes, including adding four more independent directors. It also laid out Mr. Black’s plan to donate $200 million to charities that support gender equality and fight sex trafficking.The review, conducted by the law firm Dechert, began after The Times reported that Mr. Black had paid Mr. Epstein at least $75 million in the years after his 2008 case in Florida. Mr. Epstein killed himself inside a Manhattan jail cell while facing federal sex-trafficking charges, which were filed amid widespread scrutiny of the plea deal he had reached a decade earlier.Dechert’s review found that Mr. Epstein had provided “legitimate advice” on trust and estate planning, tax issues and matters related to Mr. Black’s extensive art collection, and other subjects.Dechert said the value of the tax savings to Mr. Black was at least $1 billion and possibly as much as $2 billion. Though at the same time, the law firm noted, Mr. Epstein also “would seek to take credit for good ideas, regardless of his level of involvement, which likely was intended to bolster his perceived value to Black.”The relationship began to deteriorate in 2016, the report said, amid a payment dispute over tens of millions of dollars in fees. The two men did not communicate after 2018, according to the review.Mr. Epstein did not invest in any Apollo-managed funds, according to the report, but it found that his companies had bought more than 200,000 shares in the private equity firm’s initial public offering and held that stake until at least September 2019 — a month after Mr. Epstein died.Many of Apollo’s biggest clients — including major pension funds, charitable foundations and sovereign wealth funds — had been awaiting the results of the report.The $63 billion Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System had said it would not invest any additional money with Apollo until the review was complete. CalPERS — the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, one of Apollo’s biggest clients — had said it expected its outside investment managers to follow the fund’s own values. Other pension funds — in Texas, Illinois and Ontario — also said they would be watching the investigation closely.In his three-page letter to investors on Monday, Mr. Black acknowledged that “heightened media scrutiny of Apollo has generated unwelcome attention” for those investors. “I personally regret any distraction that may have caused,” he wrote. Mr. Black said Apollo had hired a law firm, WilmerHale, to look into its reputational risk management practices and suggest improvements.Apollo grew out of the ashes of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment bank that collapsed in 1990 amid a trading investigation that sent the since-pardoned Michael Milken to prison.Although Mr. Black started Apollo with his younger partners — Mr. Harris is 56 and Mr. Rowan 58 — he has been long been the face and voice of the firm.In building Apollo into a global financial powerhouse, Mr. Black has made himself and his co-founders immensely rich: His personal fortune is estimated at more than $8 billion, and he owns a massive private art collection — including a version of Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” — and is the chairman of the Museum of Modern Art.But when Apollo held its most recent earnings call in late October, there were already signs his dealings with Mr. Epstein were causing ripples, both in the firm and among investors. In an unusual move, Mr. Black read a brief statement about the Epstein matter before handing over the meeting to Mr. Harris and Mr. Rowan.Apollo has long specialized in buying up distressed companies and retooling them, but it also boasts large credit, infrastructure and real estate businesses. Mr. Rowan was the driving force behind Apollo’s thriving insurance business and its insurance subsidiary, Athene Holding, which has fueled the Wall Street’s firm earnings in recent years.At one time, both Mr. Rowan and Mr. Harris were seen as the heirs apparent to Mr. Black. But with Mr. Rowan’s decision to pull back from day-to-day affairs, many on Wall Street assumed the job would fall to Mr. Harris, who has the run the nuts and bolts of Apollo’s vast buyout operation.Mr. Harris, who is an owner of the Philadelphia 76rs basketball team and the New Jersey Devils hockey team, said he would “fully support” Mr. Rowan as chief executive. “I will focus on expanding our global search for investor returns, which is at the core of our success,” he said in a statement.As the only three members of Apollo’s executive committee, the founders hold considerable sway over the company. As of now, the decision to name Mr. Rowan as Mr. Black’s successor does not need approval of the company’s board. And all three men — who have much of their net worth tied up in the company — have a vested interest in the stability of the firm.</body>

	<title>The Road to Clemency From Trump Was Closed to Most Who Sought It</title>
	<author>Kenneth P. Vogel</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Eliyahu Weinstein got word that two-thirds of his 24-year sentence for investment fraud was going to be commuted by President Donald J. Trump after the White House chief of staff called a well-connected Washington lobbyist who had been hired to lead his clemency push.Lawrence McCarroll learned that the petition he had filed with the Justice Department and the letter he had sent to the president had failed to win him a commutation of the remaining six years on his 33-year sentence for a nonviolent drug offense when his mother emailed from her home in Kenosha, Wis., to tell him his name had not appeared in news reports about Mr. Trump’s final round of clemency.“I cried and cried and cried myself to sleep,” said Mr. McCarroll’s mother, Judy McCarroll. She said she was left with the impression that the clemency process favored people who “paid thousands, maybe millions, or probably did favors for Trump,” adding: “You had to be connected. You had to be in that inside clique. And if you weren’t, you don’t have anything coming.”The contrast between the treatment of Mr. Weinstein and Mr. McCarroll underscores the two very different systems for determining who received clemency during Mr. Trump’s presidency.In one system, people like the McCarrolls mostly hung their hopes on the regular process run by the Justice Department, which often took years to produce a response, if one came at all.In the other system, people like Mr. Weinstein skipped the line and got their petitions directly on the president’s desk because they had money or connections, or allies who did. The team working for Mr. Weinstein’s release included Alan M. Dershowitz, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers during his first impeachment.It is this latter system through which Mr. Trump awarded the vast majority of his pardons, which wipe out convictions, and commutations, which reduce prison sentences.Of the nearly 240 pardons and commutations issued by Mr. Trump, only 25 came through the rigorous process for identifying and vetting worthy clemency petitions overseen by the Justice Department, according to a tally kept partly by Margaret Love, who ran the department’s clemency process from 1990 to 1997 as the United States pardon attorney. The system has a backlog of 14,000 applications, including one from Mr. McCarroll.The other pardons and commutations came through an ad hoc White House process that favored applications benefiting or pushed by Mr. Trump’s allies, friends and family.In addition to rewarding people like Mr. Weinstein whose allies could afford to buy access to the highest levels of the administration, the results included pardons for people with direct personal relationships with the former president, such as his longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr., his former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his son-in-law’s father, Charles Kushner.The Justice Department had recommended against clemency for some of the people granted it by Mr. Trump. Other beneficiaries of Mr. Trump’s commutations, including Mr. Weinstein, had only recently filed petitions with the department that were listed as pending. And some pardon recipients — including Mr. Stone, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Manafort — would not have been eligible under the department’s rules, which require people to wait five years after being released from confinement to apply.Presidents are not obligated to heed any rules or guidelines on granting clemency, which is among the most unchecked and unilateral of executive powers.But legal scholars, pardon lawyers and advocates for greater use of clemency say Mr. Trump’s approach exacerbated flaws in the process, and extended the inequality that pervades the justice system to a constitutional power that is intended to be a check on that system.“This is the ultimate corruption of a system that was set up to serve a public purpose, but has been privatized to allow anybody who has connections to get to the front of the line,” said Ms. Love, who now represents clients seeking pardons.While criminal justice reform advocates say the Justice Department’s clemency process should be expedited and improved, some praise the approach taken by former President Barack Obama, who issued more than 1,900 clemency grants, mostly to people who had been recommended by the Justice Department.“When we worked on clemency during the Obama administration, it was based on objective criteria, not recommendations of some political ally or some celebrity,” said Kevin Ring, who served time in federal prison for his role in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal and is president of the criminal justice reform group FAMM, formerly known as Families Against Mandatory Minimums.The group runs a closed Facebook forum for 7,000 family members of inmates, which filled with anxious but excited messages of prayer and hope for the release of loved ones in the run-up to Mr. Trump’s final round of clemency grants, issued 12 hours before he left office.“And I was incredibly sad, because I thought you really have next to no chance, because he is not using the process that your loved one would even be in the mix for,” Mr. Ring said.Even some beneficiaries of clemency grants by Mr. Trump concede that the process is not equitable.There are “so many thousands of inmates that never get a chance to even have their names put in there, so that’s just so unfair,” said Barry Wachsler, who paid legal fees associated with Mr. Weinstein’s court appeals and clemency push. “Does it help if you have money and the right connections? You know, I guess it does. It definitely does.”A Long Island businessman, Mr. Wachsler said he met Mr. Weinstein by chance five years ago when he went to visit a friend in federal prison who introduced the two men.Mr. Weinstein, 45, had pleaded guilty in 2013 to charges related to a Ponzi-style real estate scheme that caused $200 million in losses, much of which came from investors from an Orthodox Jewish community in New Jersey with which he was associated. Prosecutors said he gained trust from potential victims by enlisting rabbis to vouch for him and making donations to Jewish organizations with his ill-gotten gains.In 2014, he pleaded guilty to charges related to defrauding additional investors, including by falsely claiming to have access to coveted Facebook shares in the company’s forthcoming initial public offering, using the funds to pay legal fees related to his earlier indictment.“Weinstein shamelessly exploited investors’ trust, using doctored documents for properties he didn’t own — including in a town that doesn’t exist — and continued to commit crimes while out on bail,” Paul J. Fishman said in a statement issued while he was overseeing the case as the United States attorney in New Jersey. Mr. Fishman added that Mr. Weinstein spent proceeds of his fraud “on fancy cars, jewelry and gambling trips,” as well as Jewish artifacts.After becoming convinced that Mr. Weinstein was poorly served by his lawyer at trial, resulting in too harsh a sentence, Mr. Wachsler, who said he visited Mr. Weinstein 150 times in prison, hired new lawyers to appeal the case. Mr. Dershowitz joined the legal fight, explaining that he was retained by a “prominent” Jewish organization that he declined to identify.After Mr. Trump lost his re-election, the strategy shifted to winning clemency from the departing president. Mr. Dershowitz, who also was paid to assist others who got commutations, advised on how to make the case for Mr. Weinstein. A clemency petition was filed with the Justice Department by the lawyers paid by Mr. Wachsler, who said he spent “a lot of money” to help Mr. Weinstein because he wanted to remedy what he saw as a grave injustice. He also hired the lobbyist Nick Muzin, paying him at least $75,000 last month, according to lobbying filings, to work his contacts in the administration.A former top political aide to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, both Republicans, Mr. Muzin had known Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, since Mr. Meadows’s first campaign for Congress as a Republican from North Carolina in 2012.Mr. Muzin said he emailed Mr. Meadows on Dec. 28 in an effort to take Mr. Weinstein’s appeal directly to Mr. Trump. “I’ve never asked you for anything since you’ve been in the big job,” Mr. Muzin said he wrote to Mr. Meadows. “I’m asking you for this.”Mr. Meadows responded, and they set up a 20-minute phone call with one of Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers the next day, after which Mr. Meadows agreed to bring the case up for priority review with the White House’s ad hoc clemency team.Mr. Muzin, who paid another lobbyist to collect letters of support for Mr. Weinstein from members of Congress, provided Mr. Meadows with those letters, as well as others from several of Mr. Weinstein’s victims and rabbis from his hometown, Lakewood, N.J.Mr. Dershowitz said he thought the degree to which connections greased the process for Mr. Weinstein or other recipients of clemency from Mr. Trump was “way exaggerated.”While he represented Mr. Trump during his first impeachment trial and advised the White House on criminal justice issues, Mr. Dershowitz said his connections “had little effect” on whether any of his clients got clemency.“I gave advice to the clients about how to frame the issues, but it was the facts and the way they were presented that got the attention of the president or didn’t,” he said, though he conceded that connections could be useful in getting in the front door.“I prefer to live in a world where all important services were allocated in a completely fair and egalitarian manner,” he said. “We don’t live in that world.”In Mr. Weinstein’s case, Mr. Meadows called Mr. Muzin with three days left in Mr. Trump’s term to share the news: The president would commute Mr. Weinstein’s sentence to time served.“We were in tears,” Mr. Muzin said, saying he was pleased to have played a role in giving Mr. Weinstein a second chance.Mr. Wachsler said he was “proud of the way that we did it,” calling it “the right way” and adding, “I can’t even describe the euphoric moment of having such a thing come down, the decision from the president.”Prosecutors who worked on Mr. Weinstein’s case saw it differently.“I’m disgusted,” tweeted Gurbir S. Grewal, who represented the Justice Department in the case as an assistant United States attorney.He added in a statement that he would “be hard-pressed to come up with someone less deserving of executive clemency. The man stole and stole, and then stole some more.”Mr. Grewal said Mr. Weinstein used stolen money to finance “contributions to individuals and groups to lobby for leniency on his behalf,” and “left a trail of victims in his wake, many of whom lost all they had and were revictimized by President Trump’s decision last week.”</body>

	<title>6 More Houston Police Officers Charged After Fatal 2019 Raid</title>
	<author>Neil Vigdor</author>
	<body>Six more Houston police officers were indicted on Monday — including one on a murder charge — in connection with a botched raid in 2019 that claimed the lives of a local couple, prosecutors said.Five of those officers were charged with first- and second-degree felonies stemming from what prosecutors said was a scheme by members of a Houston Police Department narcotics squad to pad their overtime pay.The indictments, announced by the Harris County district attorney, Kim Ogg, at a news conference, brought to 12 the total number of current and former officers charged as part of a sweeping investigation into police misconduct and corruption that stemmed from the raid. Two are charged with murder.Monday’s indictments came nearly two years after narcotics squad members burst into the home of Rhogena Nicholas, 58, and Dennis Tuttle, 59, who were killed in the Jan. 28, 2019, shootout. Four officers were injured by gunfire in the raid, including one who was paralyzed, the authorities said.“The consequences of corruption are that two innocent people and their dog were shot to death in their home by police,” Ms. Ogg said in a statement. “Four officers were shot, one paralyzed, and now all of them will face jurors who will determine their fate.”Officer Felipe Gallegos, who Ms. Ogg said shot Mr. Tuttle in what she characterized as an intentional homicide, on Monday became the second narcotics squad member to face a murder charge for his role in the raid.Prosecutors contend the raid should never have been authorized but was approved when another former officer, Gerald Goins, who was charged with murder in August 2019, provided false information to a municipal judge who signed a warrant.Another officer, Steven Bryant, was charged at that time with tampering with a governmental record. Prosecutors say that Mr. Bryant lied on a police report that he had recovered a plastic bag with a white napkin and two small packets containing black tar heroin at the scene of the raid, and that they were the same drugs purchased by a confidential informant who did not exist.If convicted, Officer Gallegos could face up to life in prison, according to Ms. Ogg, who declined to elaborate on the evidence against Officer Gallegos.Rusty Hardin, a lawyer for Officer Gallegos, said during a news conference on Tuesday that his client had shown valor during the raid and had been responding to a deadly threat. He said the Harris County grand jury that indicted Officer Gallegos had made an error.“No question about it, they indicted a hero,” Mr. Hardin said. “This man did not even begin shooting until two different officers had already been shot by Mr. Tuttle.”Ms. Ogg said the two-year investigation by her office exposed a scheme by members of the narcotics squad to pad their overtime pay.Three of the officers — Oscar Pardo, Cedell Lovings and Nadeem Ashraf — were charged with first-degree felonies of engaging in organized criminal activity related to theft of a public servant and tampering with a governmental record. If convicted, they could face up to life in prison.Daniel J. Werlinger, a lawyer for Officer Ashraf, said in an interview on Monday night that his client would be vindicated.“When it’s all said and done, we believe that evidence will show that my client and the other officers did not commit any criminal offense,” Mr. Werlinger said.A lawyer for Officer Pardo said he had just taken the case and was not immediately prepared to comment.A lawyer for Officer Lovings, who Ms. Ogg said was paralyzed after being shot in the raid, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday night.Two other officers — Frank Medina and Griff Maxwell — were charged with second-degree felonies of engaging in organized criminal activity related to theft of a public servant and tampering with a governmental record. They could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.A lawyer for Officer Maxwell disputed the charges against his client in a statement on Monday night.“Griff is an innocent man and a dedicated public servant,” the lawyer, Nathan Hennigan, said. “Shame on Ogg for this cynical political prosecution.”A lawyer for Officer Medina did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday night.In a statement on Monday, Chief Art Acevedo of the Houston police expressed his frustration over the widening scope of the case, including the murder charge against Officer Gallegos.“I have said many times that the other officers involved in the incident, including the officer indicted today, had no involvement in obtaining the warrant and responded appropriately to the deadly threat posed to them during its service,” Chief Acevedo said.The chief also noted that a Houston Police Department investigation had exposed the misconduct of Mr. Goins and Mr. Bryant.Douglas Griffith, president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, said he would comment on the indictments on Tuesday.A spokeswoman for Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a statement on Monday that “the legal process will run its course.”Boyd Smith, a lawyer for Mr. Tuttle’s family, said in an interview on Monday that the family had not received all of the details about the raid and planned to file a lawsuit in the case this week.“This narcotics unit was allowed to develop into this completely untethered dangerous subculture with no accountability whatsoever,” Mr. Smith said.Michael P. Doyle, a lawyer for Ms. Nicholas’s family, accused the city in a statement on Monday of covering up the facts in the case and said the indictments raised questions.“How high does the corruption of H.P.D. Narcotics Squad 15 go and why has the City and H.P.D. fought so hard, still, to conceal the basic facts about what happened before, during and after the murderous raid?” Mr. Doyle said.</body>

	<title>How Theater Stepped Up to Meet the Trump Era</title>
	<author>Laura Collins-Hughes</author>
	<body>On the Tuesday morning in June 2015 when Donald J. Trump waved his way down, down, down a golden-edged escalator in Trump Tower to announce his presidential candidacy on a stage below, he set the United States on a trajectory that much of the country wasn’t anticipating. The theater, for one, was busy heading in a very different direction, and in a vastly different spirit.“Hamilton,” already a phenomenon downtown, would alight on Broadway in less than a month, powered by an exhilarating wealth of talent — people of color, almost all. Rebuking in rhyme the racism and xenophobia that have always been embedded in the American way, it was a potent emblem of the Obama years: This is what greatness can be.But the momentum that started with “Hamilton” in the theater only accelerated during the Trump administration. As artists watched liberties threatened and inequities exacerbated, the work we saw became more urgent than it had been in decades, and thrillingly so.For the most part, it didn’t aim straight at the president, though a “Julius Caesar” with a Trumpian title character managed to trigger the right-wing outrage machine when Oskar Eustis staged it in Central Park in 2017.Rather, producers elevated formally adventurous, politically incendiary plays — like Heidi Schreck’s “What the Constitution Means to Me” and Jeremy O. Harris’s “Slave Play” — that spoke meaningfully to our nation’s troubled soul. Audiences, hungering for that holiest of dramatic experiences, catharsis, used the ritual of theatergoing to think and hurt and heal.This is not to credit Trump, who has demonstrated little use for culture beyond celebrity. It is simply to acknowledge, with wonder and gratitude, the abundance of work crackling with brilliance that lately has enriched the theater.Not that American stages were or have become any kind of Eden. For all their professed liberal inclusivity, they are and always have been dominated by white men from comfortable backgrounds. But the advent of Trump, with his swaggering, tough-guy masculinity and aggressive, loud-and-proud whiteness, demanded action.The theater couldn’t get away anymore with just talking the talk. If it was what it claimed to be, it had to listen at long last to calls for change and begin to walk the walk.And it did so in the smartest possible way, responding to Trump as to an emergency. It largely did not get lured, the way a lot of the media did, into turning its spotlight on his supposedly disenfranchised supporters. There was no deluge of plays about the president.Quick takes produced in 2017, like Robert Schenkkan’s “Building the Wall” and Michael Moore’s “The Terms of My Surrender,” didn’t add much to the discourse, and Anne Washburn’s 2019 “Shipwreck” hasn’t aged well. Will Arbery’s dispatch about conservative Catholics in the heartland, “Heroes of the Fourth Turning,” was an Off Broadway hit, but having been raised Catholic in flyover country, I found it less than revelatory.What proved vital was the critical mass of works that probed the roots of our distress and enmity. Although many were in development before Trump’s election — none of the social ills that have consumed us sprang into being in 2016, after all — their staging during his tenure asserted a creed directly counter to the one espoused by the White House.After women across the country greeted the Trump administration by marching through the streets in pink hats, we saw female anger and the reasons for it taken seriously onstage, in shows like Aleshea Harris’s “Is God Is,” Halley Feiffer’s “The Pain of My Belligerence” and Kirsten Childs’s “Bella: An American Tall Tale.”“What the Constitution Means to Me,” a sunnily furious, meticulously argued indictment of the nation’s second-classing of women, struck such a chord that it transferred to Broadway, went on a national tour and was filmed for Amazon.Off Broadway, Emily Mann’s Gloria Steinem bio-play “Gloria: A Life” became an event in a way it likely would not have been if so many feminists hadn’t felt so alarmed by the president. Something similar happened with Waterwell’s “The Courtroom,” a verbatim performance of immigration court transcripts that forced audiences to consider how we as a nation — even under Trump’s predecessors — had gotten so cruel.As the crisis of lethal violence against Black bodies became ever more dire, Aleshea Harris’s “What to Send Up When It Goes Down,” Antoinette Nwandu’s “Pass Over,” Dael Orlandersmith’s “Until the Flood” and Nataki Garrett and Andrea LeBlanc’s “The Carolyn Bryant Project” were blistering feats of witness and interrogation.Further form-bending pieces confronted other facets of racism and intersecting strains of bigotry, such as misogyny and homophobia: Jackie Sibblies Drury’s “Marys Seacole” and her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Fairview,” Donja R. Love’s “one in two,” Lydia R. Diamond’s “Toni Stone,” David Henry Hwang and Jeanine Tesori’s “Soft Power,” James Ijames’s “TJ Loves Sally 4 Ever.”And, of course, “Slave Play,” whose set reflected our faces back at us, insisting that we recognize our involvement in its trauma. (That design, by Clint Ramos, got one of the show’s record-breaking 12 nominations for the yet-to-be-held 2020 Tony Awards.) Like “Constitution,” it was an unusually provoking show for Broadway.Ditto Young Jean Lee’s “Straight White Men” (not a love letter to them) and Taylor Mac’s corpse-filled tragicomedy, “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” about the bloody messes that rulers make and ordinary people are left to clean up. Its tiny glimmer of hope for the future was a baby wearing a shark onesie. That’ll scare Trump, huh?Just as thoughtfully political were shows like Michael R. Jackson’s Pulitzer-winning “A Strange Loop”; Shaina Taub and Laurie Woolery’s “As You Like It”; and David Byrne’s “American Utopia,” each an openhearted musical affirmation of our shared humanity.Some of my memories of theatergoing in the Trump era seem even more lacerating now. At Ensemble Studio Theater in May 2017, Emily Chadick Weiss’s “The Fork,” a one-act comedy about killing the president, was met with delighted, unhesitating laughter — a response as jarring at the time as it was telling about the state of our civic health.Then there was a 2018 performance of “Constitution” at New York Theater Workshop, only days after Christine Blasey Ford’s Senate committee testimony and before Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court. In that fraught week, the raw sobs of a woman behind me drowned out whole passages of dialogue.There was also an afternoon at Theater for a New Audience in 2019, when quite a few white spectators at “Fairview” stayed planted in their seats even as the show, making its central point, dared them to look at the space we were sharing from an unaccustomed vantage.What echoes loudest in my mind, though, is a question from the French director Ariane Mnouchkine. In the fall of 2017, I went to Paris to watch her rehearse her company in “A Room in India,” a play she was bringing to New York. I had been at the company’s theater only minutes when she told me, worriedly, that three of her Afghani-French actors were having trouble securing their visas. She blamed Trump.Then she asked me, sharply, “What have you done?” By electing him, that is — and it didn’t matter whom I, personally, had voted for. She meant all Americans, because his election had happened on our watch.Her question, I think, is at the root of the American theater’s response to Trump’s ascent, which blindsided not just much of this country but also much of the world. If we as a people were to make any sense of it, we had to ask ourselves what we had done and how things had gotten so bad.The old intellectual parlor games wouldn’t do the trick. To process this, new stories were required.So the theater, beginning to dismantle some of the walls that had kept so many people out, tapped into the profusion of artistry waiting there. In doing that, it rose to the task.Now, faced with the existential challenge of coming back from the pandemic shutdown, it has to keep at it. It cannot revert to old inequities, onstage or backstage.As Schreck‘s debate opponent argues in “Constitution”: “Just like us this document is flawed. But just like us it is also capable of getting better.”So is the theater.</body>

	<title>Democrats Should Act as if They Won the Election</title>
	<author>Jamelle Bouie</author>
	<body>If President Biden’s plan for Covid relief ever passes the Senate, it won’t be with the 10 Republican votes it needs to clear a filibuster.“I’m going to suggest that we get together and talk about what we think would be a reasonable package, and one that could garner bipartisan support,” said Senator Susan Collins of Maine to reporters after a conference call with a bipartisan group of 16 senators led by her and Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, another necessary vote, isn’t just skeptical of the cost, he’s skeptical that the country needs another relief bill so soon after the last one. “I think at this early stage, just having passed $900 billion in relief, we need to understand where is the money going,” Romney said in an interview with CNN on Sunday. “It is important we don’t borrow trillions of dollars from the Chinese for things that may not be absolutely necessary.”Without Republican support, Democrats have two options for passing Biden’s plan into law. They could use “reconciliation” — a limited-use parliamentary maneuver that lets any deficit-neutral budget-related bill pass with a simple majority — or they could end the legislative filibuster and rid themselves of the burden of a 60-vote threshold for action. Democrats could then pass the relief package and anything else they had the votes for.The choice is simple. Change the rules and govern or leave them as is and struggle on the way to likely defeat in the next elections.This isn’t the first Democratic majority to have to deal with this kind of problem. Sixty years ago this month, Sam Rayburn, the Democratic speaker of the house, faced a similar situation. The president-elect, John F. Kennedy, had promised to take America toward a “new frontier” of reform, including new civil rights legislation. But Howard Smith of Virginia, the 78-year-old Dixiecrat chairman of the House Rules Committee, was less than keen on making that journey.The Rules Committee was where legislation went to live or die. It decided whether a bill moved to the floor for full consideration or if it was buried and forgotten. The 12-person committee was meant to act like a traffic cop, controlling the flow of legislation to the entire House. Under Smith, however, the committee used its broad powers to restrict the scope of activity altogether.Smith’s main target was liberal legislation, which he blocked in partnership with William M. Colmer of Mississippi (the other Dixiecrat on the committee) as well as the four Republicans in the minority. What on paper was a committee controlled by eight Democrats was, in practice, a committee controlled by a bipartisan group of six conservatives, who only had to tie a vote to kill a bill.For Rayburn, this was intolerable. He wanted Kennedy to succeed — or at least, to have a chance at success — and Smith’s control of the Rules Committee made that impossible. So Rayburn had to act. Liberal members had already conferred with him on how to break conservative control of the committee. He had three options. He could revive an old rule that would take all bills out of the committee after 21 days. He could purge Colmer and give his spot to a loyal soldier. Or, since committee size was set by majority vote of the House, he could move to make it bigger.The first option would make the floor unmanageable. Rayburn still needed a traffic cop. And the second option would cause a schism as conservative Southern Democrats broke from the party to defend one of their own (and head off another civil rights bill — Rayburn had helped shepherd the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960). He chose the third. The Rules Committee could be as small as five members or as large as 15. Smith could keep his coalition. With three additional members, two Democrats and one Republican, liberals and moderates would have an 8-7 majority. They could block legislation as needed but they could also let Kennedy’s bills through.Rayburn chose door number three, but not before acting as if he might go through door number two. After his meeting with House liberals, Rayburn’s office told The New York Times of a plan to purge Colmer from the Rules Committee. Rayburn tried to effect some compromise with Smith, but the Dixiecrat wouldn’t budge. At this point, Rayburn endorsed the plan to enlarge the committee. Smith could have stopped it there — the bill to add members had to go through him — but he allowed it through, on the assumption that Republicans and Dixiecrats would kill it on the floor.On the last day of the month, Jan. 31, with Kennedy now in office, the House took a vote. According to The Times, it was a “tense debate that produced cheers and applause” as well as “derisive ‘ahs’ and laughter from members.” Smith and his Republican allies accused Rayburn of “packing” the Rules Committee and making it a “rubber stamp for whatever the new Administration proposes.” Rayburn, for his part, urged members to adopt the resolution since “This House should be allowed on great measures to work its will,” even “if the Committee on Rules is so constituted as not to allow the House to pass on those things.”When the votes were finally counted, Rayburn had won, 217 to 212, with most of the Southern delegation in opposition.“This triumph did not mean complete success for the New Frontier,” the historian James Smallwood wrote in a 1973 journal article on the Rules Committee fight, “it only meant that the entire House could consider its proposals and that the majority would rule.”Here in the present, Senate Republicans aren’t the only ones pumping the brakes on the president’s agenda. On Monday, Manchin announced his total support for the Senate filibuster in an interview with Politico. “If I haven’t said it very plain, maybe Senator McConnell hasn’t understood, I want to basically say it for you. That I will not vote in this Congress, that’s two years, right? I will not vote” to change the filibuster.Likewise, a spokeswoman for Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona said that the senator is “against eliminating the filibuster, and she is not open to changing her mind about the filibuster.”In 1961, the prospect of gridlock and the possibilities opened up by a new administration motivated a coalition of liberals and moderates to change the rules and clear a path that would, in just a few short years, allow Congress to pass some of the most important legislation in its history.Today, liberals see the opportunity of the moment. But moderates don’t appear to be frustrated enough with gridlock and inaction to change the rules of the chamber. They seem to think they can negotiate Republicans out of their partisanship and win votes for policies — a $15 federal minimum wage, a new Voting Rights Act — that Republicans have already deemed unacceptable. And they seem to think that failure won’t matter, that Americans won’t notice how the Democratic Party campaigned on help and assistance but never delivered. Yes, without the filibuster to protect them, moderate members will have to take the occasional tough vote. But their constituents will probably care more about checks and vaccines than whether their senator voted with their more liberal colleagues.At this point, American elections are almost completely nationalized. The broad, diverse coalition that is the Democratic Party will either rise or fall together. Even members with their own personal political appeal need the entire party to win if they are to wield any influence over government. If Manchin wants the government to spend $4 trillion on infrastructure, then he’ll need the Democratic Party to succeed in as many areas as it can.The first step toward victory is a government that can act. So, sure, moderate Democrats can keep the filibuster if they want. But they should prepare for when the voting public decides it would rather have the party that promises nothing and does nothing than the one that promises quite a bit but won’t work to make any of it a reality.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Citing ‘partisan gridlock,’ Republican Senator Rob Portman says he will not seek re-election in 2022.</title>
	<author>Carl Hulse</author>
	<body>Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a Republican with deep ties to the former party establishment, announced on Monday that he would not seek re-election in 2022, voicing frustration with the deep polarization and partisanship in Washington.“It has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and mark progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision,” Mr. Portman said in a statement disclosing what was viewed as a surprise announcement coming so soon after the last election.Mr. Portman, a former top trade and budget official in the administration of George W. Bush, was once regarded as a conservative stalwart, but as his party has shifted to the right in recent years, he has come to be seen as one of the few centrist Republican senators interested in striking bipartisan deals. He was one of the lawmakers responsible for pushing through the new North American trade deal in 2019 and was part of a bipartisan coalition that pushed the House and Senate leadership late last year to embrace a pandemic relief measure after months of delay.His decision to step aside illustrates how difficult it has become for more mainstream Republicans to navigate the current political environment, with hard-right allies of former President Donald J. Trump insisting that Republican members of Congress side with them or face primary contests.Mr. Portman called it a “tough time to be in public service.”“We live in an increasingly polarized country where members of both parties are being pushed further to the right and further to the left, and that means too few people who are actively looking to find common ground,” he said.Mr. Portman, who also served 12 years in the House, would have been seeking his third Senate term. He said he made his decision public now to give others time to prepare for a statewide race.</body>

	<body>Like many people I know, I have lately been bewitched by the television show “Ted Lasso,” which made its endearing debut on Apple TV+ this summer. I started devouring it at nearly the same moment I began the most recent season of Jonathan Goldstein’s near-perfect podcast, “Heavyweight,” and while I was gobbling the remains of Season 2 of “Sex Education,” a beloved series on Netflix.None of these choices was accidental, I now realize. I was unconsciously gravitating toward them as a kind of post-traumatic therapy. Serotonin in pixels, oxytocin in bytes.Part of the appeal of these series is that goodness and decency win, each and every time. (Squint, and Ted Lasso is President Biden with a mustache and a fondness for baking.) They also involve storylines in which the central characters slowly gain control over key aspects of their lives — subduing the ungovernable, making sense of the illegible, closing open loops.But what moved me more than anything else? They’re about repairing the world bond by bond, one broken relationship at a time. For this particular moment, they’re the perfect entertainment Rx.In his Inaugural Address, Biden rattled off a dire inventory of crises we face as a nation: The assault on truth. The assault on democracy. Climate change, the coronavirus, our badly damaged international alliances. Runaway income inequality. Poison wells of racism that seem to never run dry.Any one of these problems would be daunting, he noted. Together, the sheer scale overwhelms. If you’re an average citizen with average means and average time at your disposal, you could be forgiven for hearing that list and taking to your bed.What’s so emboldening and life-affirming about these three series, I think, is that they offer a vision of making a difference that’s actually achievable in scale. Small kindnesses. Mending rifts. Rebuilding communities, even if that community is just a bunch of demoralized soccer hooligans.A quick précis, if you’re unacquainted with the joys of these shows:Ted Lasso is a rube savant from Kansas who’s been recruited to take over an English soccer team, though the only kind of football he knows is the American variety. What he doesn’t know is that he’s been cynically set up to fail — the team owner badly wants revenge on her philandering ex-husband, and what better way than to slowly euthanize his precious team? But but but: Lasso is so largehearted that even the most brittle creatures soften in his presence, and his solution to coaching a sport whose rules elude him is simple: Unknot the psychological difficulties of individual players, one at a time, until they all play well with one another.I am now rereading this and thinking I’ve made the show sound almost criminally cheesy. It isn’t. It is wickedly funny (I mean, Jason Sudeikis) and committed to a certain kind of outlandishness; the humor just doesn’t come from a place of anger.Moving on: “Sex Education”! It has all the delights of the best shows about adolescents: operatic crushes, intense friendships, complicated families, high school Babylon, vexed sex.But what got me hooked wasn’t really any of those things. It was, again, the notion of healing the world person by person, even if that person is the school thug. The male protagonist, Otis, is the child of a sex therapist, and though he’s woefully inexperienced in the ways of all flesh, he has absorbed enough of his mother’s craft to start a sex-therapy clinic with a friend. He understands that most problems in the sack involve emotions, rather than hydraulics, and his counseling, almost always, is to get his fellow students to embrace the shame-parts of themselves.And finally, the podcast “Heavyweight,” perhaps my favorite of the lot. The conceit is so simple and so satisfying that it’s kind of amazing a previous incarnation didn’t exist on radio or TV. The host, Jonathan Goldstein — whose comic gifts are matched only by his awkwardness — undertakes the improbably sentimental task of resolving emotional burdens people have carried around for years. He’s in the closure business, which often means answering questions or confronting long-deferred tasks. As in: Say, can you help me scatter my dad’s 16-year-old ashes on the 18th hole of a private golf course? Or: Say, can you tell me why I was dumped by those girls way back in middle school?Or most famously, in the show’s early breakout episode: Say, can you tell me why Moby never so much as thanked me for lending him my box set of Alan Lomax’s “Songs From the South,” much less returned it? Because hello, sampling them is what made him a superstar.Goldstein is a time-traveler, part shrink and part detective, helping to rewrite the self-punishing, misconceived stories people tell themselves — or to give them a story in the first place, where once there was none. And stories are crucial to being able to make sense of old traumas.For many Americans, the Trump years were a pretty traumatic experience. If one of the hallmarks of trauma is powerlessness — this I learned from the psychotherapist and author Daphne de Marneffe, who memorably described life under Trump as an endless joy ride with a drunk at the wheel — here are shows with protagonists who show others how to take custody of their troubles.If another hallmark of trauma is that it’s always humming in the background, even if it’s on an invidious frequency we can’t detect — “the body keeps the score,” as the psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk wrote in his popular book of the same name — well, here are stories that allow us to cry and find release.And if yet another hallmark of trauma is avoidance and withdrawal, here are stories that allow us to imagine salvation in altruism and connection.Our connections — with individuals (friends, neighbors) and communities (civic organizations, neighborhood groups, religious institutions) — have been in decline for decades in America. Strengthening them has been a preoccupation on both the left and the right, from the scholarship of Robert Putnam to the policy work of Oren Cass.All of us yearn for those lost bonds, in quarantined life more than ever.So yes: What were once fissures in American life have now become canyons, and many of our woes are as wide as the world — literally, in some cases, like global warming and re-establishing international trust. Yet whenever I’m listening to or watching these stories, I am reminded that we needn’t be crippled, necessarily, by the immensity of the difficulties ahead. Sometimes it pays to think small.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

	<title>Schools Were Set to Reopen. Then the Teachers’ Union Stepped In.</title>
	<author>Tracey Tully</author>
	<body>After several false starts over the last two months, public schools in Montclair, N.J., an affluent New York City suburb, were finally set to reopen Monday for the first time since the pandemic shut them down in March.Students, sorted into two groups, the Mounties and the Bulldogs, would attend school in person two days a week and log in remotely the other three — a hybrid model of instruction that has enabled a majority of districts in New Jersey and the country’s largest public school system, New York City, to reopen.Then the township’s powerful teachers’ union stepped in, and the plan was abruptly scrapped.“We are so sad,” Heather Weiss, a mother of two Montclair public school students, said soon after the superintendent announced late Friday, “with deep regret,” that he did not have enough teachers to properly staff the district’s schools.The decision to keep schools closed indefinitely capped a tense week in a community known for its liberal politics: Elementary teachers, citing coronavirus safety concerns, boycotted in-school prep sessions in defiance of the superintendent, and a heated board of education meeting on Wednesday lasted until nearly midnight.The superintendent and leaders from the union, the Montclair Education Association, met on Saturday with a mediator and were scheduled to talk again on Monday, according to a township official briefed on the negotiations.The battle playing out in real time underscores the challenges districts across the country face as they try to get the public school system back up and running for in-person learning, a goal President Biden has said would be among his first priorities.In Chicago, the teachers’ union voted to authorize a strike if the district seeks to force educators back into buildings. In Bellevue, Wash., a wealthy Seattle suburb, district officials took the union to court to require teachers to participate in in-person instruction. And in Fairfax County, Va., outside Washington, a union leader said Thursday that hybrid instruction must remain a long-term option until all students were vaccinated.In New York City, schools reopened briefly in September, but closed as infection rates increased. They reopened last month to elementary students only, but are facing pressure from the teachers’ union to close if the city’s seven-day test positivity rate reaches 9 percent, as measured by the state.The decision to return to in-person learning is made more complex in New Jersey, where coronavirus infections have been surging and teachers are not among the first groups prioritized for vaccines — a policy that the statewide teachers’ union, a close ally of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, has refrained from criticizing. Yet over the last week, some union leaders and superintendents have cited the policy to justify efforts to keep schools closed.Montclair is no ordinary town.The newly elected mayor, Sean Spiller, is the No. 2 official at the statewide teachers’ union, the New Jersey Education Association. The president of the local teachers’ labor group, Petal Robertson, is competing for a leadership job at the association. And one of the governor’s top political strategists, Brendan Gill — an Essex County commissioner who is also the township’s Democratic chairman — lives there, as does the state’s new education commissioner, Angelica Allen-McMillan.Montclair is also home to an array of prominent journalists, academics and television celebrities.All this gives the battle outsize relevance in a state where the governor, a Democrat running for re-election, has repeatedly said that he wants students back in schools but has done little to require it.On Monday night, teachers in a nearby district, South Orange-Maplewood, followed Montclair’s lead.The teachers’ union, South Orange and Maplewood Education Association, released a letter notifying the superintendent and school board that they would no longer participate in in-person instruction. The union’s action comes only a week after schools reopened for the first time since March.“We will continue to educate passionately but will do so from our homes until such time as temperatures are moderate enough to avoid bone-chilling working conditions in violation of minimum temperature standards and vaccines are made available to educators,” the union wrote.Montclair’s teachers’ union has said that communication with the superintendent, Dr. Jonathan C. Ponds, has been poor. Information and reports about ventilation and other safety measures in school buildings were not provided, they said, and a meeting with union leaders was canceled, leaving them with little confidence in his assurances that the schools were safe.The union has also noted that cases of the virus are more prevalent now than they were over the last two months, when the district delayed earlier plans to reopen.In a slide show presentation to the superintendent, the union asked: “With case of transmissions on the steady increase, even more since the holiday breaks, is now really a good time to return to in-person instruction?”On Friday, the state reported 4,437 new virus infections; Essex County officials said that day that there were 14 new cases in Montclair.Only the elementary schools were set to reopen on Monday; middle and high schools were expected to reopen in two weeks.On Monday morning, parents angered by the new delay staged a protest outside Edgemont Elementary School, lining up dozens of backpacks in place of children. A parent group that has been pushing for schools to reopen asked students to keep their cameras off during Monday’s live streamed classes and to instead post a background supportive of the return to in-person instruction.Dr. Ponds, who started working in Montclair only seven months ago, has maintained that “months of preparation” have ensured that schools are safe for teachers and students.“Every school in New Jersey is mandated to offer in-person instruction,” he said in a statement last week.On Monday, he said his goal remained “returning our students to the classroom as soon as possible.”“Although we have not reached an amicable resolution, we continue our discussions with the M.E.A., the mediator and legal counsel,” he said in a statement.Montclair has churned through superintendents over the last eight years, and Dr. Ponds was awarded a five-year contract in May in hope of fostering stability in the 6,760-student district with pronounced infrastructure needs. (In 2018, a stairwell collapsed at the high school, delaying the start of the school year.)Support for the teachers and their union remains high in a community known for its progressive values.“Teachers are not in charge of the coronavirus. Teachers are not in charge of the vaccine schedule. Teachers are not the ones in charge of building structural and ventilation safety,” Caitlyn Cade, a mother of two Montclair students, wrote in support of the union. “Yet they are the victims of displaced anger by a group of vocal parents.”Mr. Murphy has said that cases of in-school transmission of the virus remain relatively low, and each week he highlights the number of districts that have returned for in-person instruction. According to a state database, there have been at least 597 cases linked to infections at 121 schools.All of the large city school districts, including Newark and Elizabeth, remain closed for in-person instruction. But as of last week, 60 percent of districts and charter school organizations were open for some form of in-person classes, state officials said.A letter-writing campaign in Montclair sponsored by the statewide teachers’ union asks parents to email Dr. Ponds and board of education members to urge them to keep instruction all virtual “until the staff has had the opportunity to be vaccinated.”On Monday, the president of the statewide union, Marie Blistan, said she believed that the state should be prepared for “interruptions in learning for maybe another year,” and that schools must ensure that each child has access to a computer and the internet for virtual instruction.Mr. Gill, the political strategist, has two children in public schools and a 73-year-old father who teaches in Montclair. He said that he did not believe the nexus between the statewide teachers’ union and the mayor had influenced reopening decisions.“I don’t think Montclair is unique from any other community in trying to manage what the proper response is,” Mr. Gill said.“There’s no disagreement that kids learn better when they’re in school, when they’re in the buildings,” he said. But it must be done safely, he added.As mayor, Mr. Spiller appoints members of the board of education. He said vaccination remains the only way to guarantee safety. But he said he believed all sides were committed to opening schools in Montclair as quickly as possible once everyone was convinced the schools were safe.“That is what everyone wants,” he said. “I have not seen anyone divided on that.”Ms. Weiss, who has a second- and seventh-grader who are looking forward to returning to school, said she was angry and disappointed by the delay.“There’s plenty of other districts, and plenty of old buildings, including in New York City, where the teachers are back,” she said. “I don’t know why we’re some anomaly.”She added, “It just seems they don’t want to go back.”</body>

	<title>What We Learned From the N.F.L.’s Conference Championships</title>
	<author>Benjamin Hoffman</author>
	<body>The Super Bowl matchup is set. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who came into the playoffs as the fifth seed in the N.F.C., will host the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 7 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. For Tom Brady, it is a chance at a seventh Super Bowl win. For Patrick Mahomes, it is an opportunity to be the first quarterback to win back-to-back titles — since Brady.The Buccaneers came into Sunday’s N.F.C. championship game as underdogs on the road, but beat the Green Bay Packers, 31-26. The Chiefs, playing in their third consecutive A.F.C. championship game, beat the Buffalo Bills, 38-24. The game did not feel that close.Here’s what we learned:Tom Brady’s faith in himself has been rewarded. At the end of last season, Brady, who was 42 at the time, seemed to be in physical decline as his New England Patriots lost a wild-card playoff game at home to the Tennessee Titans. Speculation was rampant that he might walk away from the game, but Brady, a six-time Super Bowl winner, bet on himself, signing with a promising young Tampa Bay team that could support him with talented wide receivers. That move paid off. Brady had a throwback regular season, tossing 40 touchdown passes. He is heading to his 10th Super Bowl, a record. And with Saints quarterback Drew Brees likely to retire, it appears safe that Brady, regardless of when he retires, will go out as the career leader in passing touchdowns.New England, meanwhile, fell apart without him. The Patriots were 7-9 and did not make the playoffs.A team will finally play a Super Bowl at home. For the first 54 Super Bowls, the game was played at a neutral site. The closest a team had come to playing the game at home was at the end of the 1979 season, when the Los Angeles Rams lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31-19, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., roughly 14 miles from the Rams’ home stadium, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. In two weeks, that streak will come to an end, as the Buccaneers, who had to win three road games to reach the Super Bowl, will be rewarded with a game on their home field at Raymond James Stadium. It is uncommon for a team to play the Super Bowl even in its home state: Teams are 2-2 in that situation.This will hardly be a typical Super Bowl. Only 22,000 people will be permitted to attend the game, many of them health care workers who will be given the tickets as a nod to their heroism during the pandemic. A raucous home crowd for a Super Bowl will have to wait for another year — hopefully it won’t take another 55 tries.Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce don’t care about your Cinderella story. The Bills were the feel-good story of the season, and they took a quick 9-0 lead on Sunday. But the combination of Hill and Kelce was simply relentless, with them combining to catch 22 passes for 290 yards, and two touchdowns by Kelce. With 13 catches, Kelce tied the N.F.L. record for receptions by a tight end in a playoff game, but the most demoralizing play of the game came from Hill who caught a 6-yard pass that the N.F.L.’s Next Gen Stats database said should have resulted in 10 yards after the catch, or a 16-yard play. Using his speed and his ability to shed tacklers, Hill gained 71. Only three plays all season exceeded their expected yardage by a wider margin.The question for the Super Bowl is how much time Patrick Mahomes will have to throw to either player, as Tampa Bay’s pass rush can make life miserable for opposing quarterbacks.It is time to wonder what qualifies as a dynasty. Kansas City has played in the A.F.C. championship game three seasons in a row, winning it twice, and has a chance to be the first team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since the Patriots did it after the 2003 and 2004 seasons. While sports teams are typically only considered a dynasty after three championships, the N.F.L.’s lack of repeat winners in recent decades in the salary cap era makes it worth considering if two titles would constitute a dynasty.If your season is on the line, the ball should be in Aaron Rodgers’s hands. The Packers, trailing by 8, faced a fourth-and-goal at Tampa Bay’s 8-yard line with just over two minutes remaining. Rather than going for it, Green Bay kicked a field goal to narrow the deficit to 5 points. As a result, Aaron Rodgers never saw the ball again. Tampa Bay was able to secure a few first downs — with help from a few penalties — and ran out the clock to ice the victory. While there was no guarantee Rodgers would have found someone in the end zone on that fourth-down play, taking the team’s fate out of Rodgers’s hands is probably something that will haunt the Packers in the off-season.If you can pressure Rodgers, you can beat him. An aggressive young defense was the Buccaneers’ calling card last season, and while the unit was inconsistent in 2020, it showed what it was capable of on Sunday. A week after Rodgers wasn’t sacked a single time and was hit only once, he was harassed all game by Tampa Bay’s front seven. Officially, the Buccaneers had five sacks and eight quarterback hits, but in reality they forced Rodgers into getting rid of the ball quickly on nearly every play. They put so much pressure on him that he made a rare mistake on a free play, not seeing that Davante Adams was wide open on the sideline on a play in which Green Bay had drawn a Tampa Bay defender offsides.The Chiefs had a plan for Stefon Diggs. All season, Diggs was the key for Buffalo. Diggs, the star wide receiver, not only set career highs in receptions and yards receiving during the regular season, but he opened up the entire field for the rest of the Bills’ offense because of the respect opposing defenses showed him. The Chiefs attacked him with press coverage throughout the first half — far more press than he saw during the regular season — all but eliminating him from the game. Diggs finished the day with six catches for 77 yards, but 34 of that came on one play late in the game when the Chiefs had a large lead and switched into a prevent defense.Buffalo needs more from its running game. Josh Allen can feel like a one-man show, throwing touchdown passes and reeling off huge runs at will. But it was abundantly clear in Sunday’s game that the Bills simply can’t run the ball beyond Allen’s scrambles. Devin Singletary, T.J. Yeldon and Isaiah McKenzie combined to carry the ball 11 times for 41 yards. Buffalo can get by with its passing game and Allen’s wild runs against a lot of teams, but if the Bills want to compete with a team like the Chiefs in future seasons, finding some balance on offense is key.</body>

	<title>Please, Biden, Try for 2 Million Shots a Day</title>
	<author>Michelle Goldberg</author>
	<body>Donald Trump’s administration overpromised on coronavirus vaccines. In November, his secretary of health and human services said there would be 40 million doses available by the end of the 2020; he was off by about a month. Trump himself promised 100 million doses in that same period. Everything he and his team said was a sales pitch, designed to foster the false impression that the pandemic they let burn out of control was on the cusp of ending.There’s a growing consensus that Joe Biden’s administration has done the exact opposite. “Biden’s early approach to virus: Underpromise, overdeliver,” says an Associated Press headline. In December, when Biden pledged 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days, some experts thought it was a reach. But now that the United States is already vaccinating a bit more than a million people a day, that figure is far too modest.Biden seemed to acknowledge that on Monday, telling reporters that the United States could get to 150 million shots in 100 days. Even that, however, is not enough.The pandemic has put members of the privileged pundit class in an unaccustomed position. I’m used to thinking about politics in terms of what the government should be doing for other people. Now, like millions and millions of others, I watch the administration with a frantic eye to my own family’s survival. (I used to think of myself as a moderately savvy person, but I’ve yet to figure out how to get vaccine appointments for my parents.) And so I track bits of data on things that previously meant nothing to me — like the production of low dead space syringes — with the terrified desperation of someone googling symptoms while awaiting biopsy results.In my voracious consumption of vaccine news, I’d been baffled as to why the United States was aiming so low. Pfizer and Moderna, makers of the two vaccines that have been authorized for emergency use, have promised 200 million doses, enough for 100 million people, by the end of March. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me he’s in touch with people at both companies, and they’ve said they’ll be able to deliver.“We’re probably on track for about two million doses a day, in terms of production,” he said, and we should, in turn, “absolutely” be able to get two million doses a day into people’s arms. If that’s true, anything less would be deeply disappointing.It’s understandable that, less than a week in, the new administration doesn’t want to set outsize expectations, especially when the Trump administration left so much confusion in its wake.“I can’t tell you how much vaccine we have, and if I can’t tell it to you then I can’t tell it to the governors and I can’t tell it to the state health officials,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Fox News on Sunday. Before the administration can fix all the bottlenecks in the system, it needs time to figure out where they are.But it still needs more ambitious goals. Because the original 100 million figure included people getting their second shots, the Biden administration’s promise meant that only about 67 million people would be fully vaccinated by the end of April. Especially with more infectious new variants spreading, that’s a figure to inspire despair, not hope. “We need the administration to do better than that,” said Jha.Underpromising, like overpromising, can breed cynicism, making people feel deceived. Conservatives are likely to be critical of the Biden administration’s rollout no matter what. (“Biden’s dishonest coronavirus expectation-setting,” said a Washington Examiner headline.) But even if you badly want this administration to succeed, it’s frustrating to have to read between the lines of public statements to get some idea of when American life might once again become minimally tolerable.“My guess is that now that they’re in office, and now that they’re getting their arms around these questions of how much supply do we have, where are the real backlogs in distribution, my guess is they’re going to come out with better projections on what they’re going to be able to do,” Jha said just before Biden came out with his new estimate.No one who cares about public health wants a return to an administration that relies on the power of positive thinking. But we do need the administration to show that it’s being as bold as this terrifying, miserable moment demands.“It’s critical for just keeping people’s spirits up,” said Jha. “Otherwise I think there’s going to be a lot of despondency” about when life will start to get even a little bit better. The administration might not be able to tell us when, exactly, it can get to two million vaccinations a day. But it should display as much furious urgency in striving toward that goal as people like me feel waiting for it.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>$200,000 Settlement for Texas Man Pepper-Sprayed While Recording Son’s Traffic Stop</title>
	<author>Azi Paybarah</author>
	<body>A city in Texas has agreed to a $200,000 settlement of a lawsuit alleging civil rights violations and police brutality brought by a man who was pepper-sprayed twice while recording his son during a traffic stop over the summer.The city of Keller, which is about 30 miles northwest of Dallas, announced on Sunday that it was “pleased” with the agreement, which still needs to be signed by all parties and filed with the court.The city will pay $5,000 toward the settlement, with the remainder to be paid by the Texas Municipal League Intergovernmental Risk Pool, with whom the city of Keller has an insurance policy, the city said.The man who sued, Marco Puente, 39, was happy with the settlement, according to one of his lawyers, Scott H. Palmer. “A quick result is obviously worth it to him, to move on and get this past him,” he said in an interview, adding that Mr. Puente has “accomplished his goals of holding them accountable and shedding a spotlight on police brutality.”After the Aug. 15 episode, one of the two officers named in the lawsuit was demoted. In addition, Chief Brad Fortune of the Keller Police Department announced several policy changes including providing more frequent reports of police activity to local lawmakers and requiring supervisors to review body and dashboard camera footage recorded by officers.Robert J. Davis, a lawyer for the two officers named in the lawsuit, declined to comment.The federal lawsuit, filed last month in the Northern District of Texas, accused the officers of excessive force as well as unlawful arrest and retaliatory arrest.The suit also accused one of the officers of racially profiling Mr. Puente’s 22-year-old son, Dillon. The Puentes are Hispanic, and the city of Keller is 87 percent white, according to census figures.After the suit was filed, Marco Puente said in an interview that even though he grew up in Keller and had family there, he and his son shared a feeling that “every time you see a cop, it’s: Is this cop going to pull us over? Are they going to target us? Do they know who we are?”In August, Mr. Puente and his son were driving in separate cars on their way to a relative’s house. Dillon was pulled over by Blake Shimanek, who was a sergeant at the time, for making an improper wide right turn, according to the lawsuit.Footage from Officer Shimanek’s body camera shows Dillon being asked to step out of the car and then quickly handcuffed. The footage shows his father recording the encounter with his smartphone from his truck, and Officer Shimanek yelling that Mr. Puente was obstructing the roadway and threatening him with arrest.When a second officer, Ankit Tomer, arrived, Officer Shimanek directed him to arrest Mr. Puente.A photo included in the lawsuit shows Officer Shimanek putting Mr. Puente in a headlock. Mr. Puente was then pepper-sprayed, according to video footage, with Officer Tomer removing Mr. Puente’s sunglasses before spraying him a second time.After being sprayed, handcuffed and placed in a patrol car, Mr. Puente repeatedly asked, to no avail, for help, according to the lawsuit. He asked for the irritant to be wiped from his eyes, and said he had trouble breathing, it said.After pulling into the sally port of the jail, Officer Tomer stopped the car and got out. Later, when the officer opened the car door again, Mr. Puente could be heard screaming, “I’m begging you man, please!”At the jail, Mr. Puente sat for seven minutes pleading for help as Officer Tomer “stood outside the vehicle having a casual conversation with other officers,” according to the lawsuit. Those seven minutes “amounted to pure torture,” it said.Mr. Puente was charged with resisting arrest and interference with public duties, Mr. Palmer, his lawyer, said. He was released the night he was arrested, and the charges were later dropped.Dillon Puente was arrested and taken to jail on charges of making an improper wide right turn. He was later released after paying a fine, Mr. Palmer said.On Sept. 8, Chief Fortune said evidence supported the allegation that Officer Shimanek had arrested Marco Puente for offenses he did not commit. Officer Shimanek was demoted to officer from his previous rank of sergeant with the opportunity to reapply to the position after one year.Officer Tomer was not disciplined.</body>

	<title>Senate Confirms Yellen as Treasury Secretary as Stimulus Talks Loom</title>
	<author>Alan Rappeport</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Janet L. Yellen, a labor economist and former Federal Reserve chair, to be Treasury secretary on Monday, putting in place a key lieutenant to President Biden at a perilous economic moment, as the new administration tries to revive an economy that has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic.By a vote of 84 to 15, the Senate confirmed Ms. Yellen, making her the first woman to hold the top job at Treasury in its 232-year history. Her quick bipartisan confirmation underscored the support she has from both Republicans and Democrats given her previous stint as Fed chair from 2014 to 2018.Ms. Yellen now faces a new and considerable challenge. As Treasury secretary, she will be responsible for helping Mr. Biden prepare the $1.9 trillion stimulus package he has proposed, steer it through Congress and — if it is approved — oversee the deployment of trillions of dollars of relief money.The magnitude of the task became clear over the weekend, as a bipartisan group of senators met virtually with senior White House officials on Sunday and expressed doubt that such a large package was necessary.Lawmakers in both parties raised the prospect of curtailing elements of the proposal, including the eligibility for a suggested round of $1,400 checks to individuals and ensuring that a more targeted distribution of additional aid, according to multiple people familiar with the discussion. They also asked the White House to provide data that would justify the proposed spending, which includes $350 billion in state and local aid and $130 billion to reopen schools shuttered by the pandemic.Now, Ms. Yellen will be thrust into the middle of the talks, responsible for convincing many Republicans and some Democrats that the economy needs another multi-trillion dollar spending package. At her confirmation hearing and in written responses to lawmakers, Ms. Yellen echoed Mr. Biden’s view that Congress must “act big” to prevent the economy from long-term scarring and defended using borrowed money to finance another aid package, saying not doing so would leave workers and families worse off.“The relief bill late last year was just a down payment to get us through the next few months,” Ms. Yellen said. “We have a long way to go before our economy fully recovers.”Ms. Yellen also argued that “near-term fiscal support is not inconsistent with long-term fiscal sustainability,” explaining that a healthier economy would ultimately generate more revenue for the government.The Biden administration has said that it hopes a package can win bipartisan support in Congress. However, Democrats have signaled a willingness to turn to a budgetary mechanism known as reconciliation that would allow them to pass the legislation with a simple majority and bypass the usual 60-vote threshold needed.David Wessel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, where Ms. Yellen most recently worked, said that she is likely to play a key role in working with Congress given her credibility with both Republicans and progressive Democrats. He suggested that, because of Mr. Biden’s long history in the Senate, Ms. Yellen could be less involved in haggling with lawmakers and deployed to make the economic case for certain policies.“I expect they’ll use her as an asset when they need an expert,” Mr. Wessel said. “Particularly if some people need to be talked into something.”While she gained the support of many Republicans, several voted against her confirmation, including Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska. Mr. Sullivan said on the Senate floor that he voted against Ms. Yellen because she refused to commit to being an advocate for “all of the above” energy policy, including natural gas and oil. Ms. Yellen has made combating climate change and creating incentives for clean energy a priority at Treasury.“As a matter of fact I thought it was shocking,” Mr. Sullivan said, noting that he made the decision to vote against Ms. Yellen’s confirmation reluctantly given her strong qualifications.In addition to negotiating with lawmakers, Ms. Yellen will have the responsibility of being the United States’ most senior economic diplomat at a time of frayed global tensions. Ms. Yellen will have to try to repair America’s economic relationships around the world, including with allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which became strained under President Donald J. Trump.Those relationships will be critical given the Biden administration’s plan to try to combat what Ms. Yellen called China’s “illegal, unfair and abusive” economic practices by marshaling allies to exert pressure on Beijing.At her confirmation hearing, Ms. Yellen said that China was “engaging in practices that give it an unfair technological advantage” and said the administration was prepared to use America’s “full array of tools” to address that. One of her first challenges will be to review the trade deal that Mr. Trump struck with Beijing, including China’s failure to meet its commitments, and determine if the United States should keep tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods.Longer term, Ms. Yellen plans to help carry out Mr. Biden’s tax proposals, which include a higher corporate tax and tax increases for the rich.Ms. Yellen plans to bring other big changes to the mission of the Treasury Department, including using its powers to help assess the economic risks of climate change and create incentives to support clean energy technologies. She will also be focused on promoting policies that reduce racial inequality.“It is the responsibility of the Treasury secretary to strengthen the U.S. economy, foster widespread economic prosperity and promote an economic agenda that leads to long-run economic growth,” Ms. Yellen said in a written response to lawmakers that was released on Thursday.Ms. Yellen will be under pressure to quickly staff a Treasury Department that had been depleted under her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin. Her deputy, Wally Adeyemo, will require Senate confirmation and Ms. Yellen will need to select under secretaries to be in charge of international affairs, sanctions and domestic finance.Earlier this month, the Treasury Department announced a chief of staff, Didem Nisanci, and a team of senior advisers, many of whom served in the Obama administration, to work with Ms. Yellen. On Monday, Treasury announced another slate of hires, including the appointment of Mark J. Mazur, a former senior Treasury official during the Obama administration, to be deputy assistant secretary for tax policy in the office of legislative affairs.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Catch up: Leon Black will step down as C.E.O. of Apollo after an inquiry found he paid $150 million to Jeffrey Epstein.</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>Leon Black, the chief executive and chairman of Apollo Global Management, announced his plan on Monday to step down as chief executive this year. The move follows an inquiry by the firm that revealed that Mr. Black had paid $158 million to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a five-year period ending in 2017. He had also lent Mr. Epstein more than $30 million, only $10 million of which was paid back, the report found. Mr. Black’s payments effectively bankrolled the lifestyle of Mr. Epstein in the years after his 2008 guilty plea in Florida to a prostitution charge involving a teenage girl.The Norwegian Data Protection Authority said on Monday that it would fine Grindr, the world’s most popular gay dating app, 100 million Norwegian Kroner, or about $11.7 million dollars, for illegally disclosing private details about its users to advertising companies. The Norwegian agency said the app had transmitted users’ precise locations, user-tracking codes and the app’s name to at least five advertising companies, essentially tagging individuals as L.G.B.T.Q. without obtaining their explicit consent, in violation of European data protection law.</body>

	<title>In U.K., Concern Grows Over Vaccine Hesitancy Among Minority Groups</title>
	<author>Isabella Kwai</author>
	<body>LONDON — Health experts, doctors and government officials in Britain are calling for a more concerted campaign to address vaccine hesitancy among minority groups, with some also urging that those groups be designated a priority for immunization against the coronavirus because they are more at risk.The government said on Monday that it would give 23 million pounds, or about $31 million, to local councils and other groups in England to encourage vaccines among those most at risk from the virus, including minority groups, by trying to combat misinformation and to build trust in the authorities.The pandemic has already thrown into sharp relief the persistent racial inequalities in Britain, which have played a role in the disproportionately high rates of infection and death among minority groups and, some say, deepened their mistrust of the government.Recent polls showed that members of Black, Asian and other minority groups in the country are less open to getting the vaccine than white people are because they worry about the vaccine’s reliability. Britain’s drug regulator, seen as a bellwether agency, has said the vaccines are safe and effective.“I am conscious some Londoners are hesitant to receive the Covid vaccine because they are from communities which have, in the past, been let down by institutions,” Mayor Sadiq Khan of London said. “But these vaccines are safe and effective, and I urge everyone who is invited to receive one to do so.”The stakes could hardly be higher for countries to address skepticism and anxiety around vaccinations. The British government is banking on a campaign to vaccinate tens of millions of people by April as an escape route from stop-and-start lockdowns and their crippling economic fallout.Maureen Pryce, a 58-year-old former caregiver of Caribbean descent, said that she had stopped taking vaccinations after one of her daughters suffered a bad reaction to one years ago. Even with family members sickened by the virus and deaths increasing in her neighborhood, her mind was made up, she said.“I’m not having it. I refuse,” she said this month. “How can we trust you?” she said of the authorities. “You have a history of lying to us.”There are deeply rooted reasons for a mistrust of health care among minority groups, experts say, with a history of abuse and racism in the medical establishment. For 40 years ending in 1972, doctors intentionally did not treat African-American men infected with syphilis to study the course of the disease. In Nigeria, Pfizer agreed to a $35 million settlement with Kano State after 11 children died in a 1996 trial of an experimental meningitis drug.And two French doctors spurred an outcry last April when they suggested Covid vaccines should be tested in African countries, where people had less access to personal protective equipment.As growing numbers of people have received the vaccine without incident, vaccine hesitancy overall appears to be waning in Britain, according to a YouGov poll in January. As of Monday, about 6.5 million in Britain, out of a population of about 67 million, had received a first dose of the vaccine.But in a survey of 12,035 people commissioned by the government’s scientific advisory group, vaccine hesitancy was higher among Black Britons and in those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and other minority ethnic backgrounds.In the city of Birmingham, for example, one health official said anecdotal evidence suggested that about half of those belonging to minority groups who were invited to receive vaccines were turning them down, according to the BBC.Members of minority groups are certainly not all skeptics. Many, in fact, are “desperate” for a vaccine that has not come quickly enough, said Halima Begum, the chief executive of Runnymede Trust, a London-based organization that advocates racial equality, adding that she had two siblings with Covid-19 in the hospital.Still, health experts and lawmakers have called for collecting more data on the vaccine rollout across different ethnic backgrounds, which they say is lacking, and to improve messaging on vaccine safety to people of color.Opposition lawmakers have lobbied the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to consider adding minority groups to a vaccine priority list, citing statistics on mortality. Doctors received some guidance from the National Health Service to prioritize ethnic minority groups if they were already eligible because of age, said Prof. Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners.The Department of Health has said that priority for vaccinations would be given to older adults and to those with underlying health conditions, including in Black and ethnic minority groups.But primary care doctors, particularly those working in multiethnic areas, have expressed worries about vaccine skepticism.To counter misinformation, local officials and community leaders have been sending messages in several languages that the approved vaccines, though fast-tracked, have been found to be safe and effective.But misinformation abounds online. There are baseless claims that the vaccine is a method of population control, that it could change a recipient’s DNA, or that it contains animal products such as pork, which might raise conflicts with some religious practices.Imams are dedicating sermons this month to reassuring the Muslim community that the vaccine is halal and advising people to take it if offered. Doctors are holding Zoom sessions answering questions for the Sikh community.Rhoda Ibrahim, a British-Somali community leader in London, said videos featuring Somali actors had been created to raise awareness about testing, mask-wearing and vaccines.Nadhim Zahawi, the Iraqi-born British minister in charge of vaccine deployment, told BBC Radio last week he was worried that ethnic minority groups might disproportionately refuse the vaccine and become infected more quickly. But he said Monday that he was working with faith and community leaders to build awareness that vaccines were safe.Still, many say that the British government should have invested far sooner in responding to these concerns.Glory Nyero, a Black analyst in social care and housing from London, said she had grown up wary of the health care system and with a sense that British institutions did not always understand people of color.“In the end, I will get it if I have to,” she said of the vaccine, adding that she worried her newborn could contract the virus. “To hear that vaccine has only been tested and run through within a year — that creates quite a lot of hysteria,” she said.Critics of the government said that in a year when racial injustice had become a global focus, lawmakers did not do enough to protect people of color, despite a review of data that showed glaring disparities in the coronavirus toll.“A colorblind policy hurts those who are most impacted,” said Ms. Begum of the Runnymede Trust. She says she wants urban areas, where many minority groups live, to be vaccinated first.Part of the chasm from the pandemic’s toll could come from longstanding disparities in wealth and housing, a government review said, noting also that people of color were more likely to be in jobs with greater exposure to the virus, such as in health care and food production.They were also more likely to have pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes and obesity, the review added, which increased the risk and severity of the infection, and may be less likely to seek help when needed because of historical racism and negative experiences with health care or at work.Salman Waqar, a family doctor and general secretary of the British Islamic Medical Association, is among those working to persuade people to take vaccines.“Any community that has been ignored and neglected is especially vulnerable,” he said. “That vulnerability’s now been exploited by the anti-vaccine messaging that’s coming in.”Benjamin Mueller contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Why Is Big Tech Policing Speech? Because the Government Isn’t</title>
	<author>Emily Bazelon</author>
	<body>In the months leading up to the November election, the social media platform Parler attracted millions of new users by promising something competitors, increasingly, did not: unfettered free speech. “If you can say it on the streets of New York,” promised the company’s chief executive, John Matze, in a June CNBC interview, “you can say it on Parler.”The giants of social media — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram — had more stringent rules. And while they still amplified huge amounts of far-right content, they had started using warning labels and deletions to clamp down on misinformation about Covid-19 and false claims of electoral fraud, including in posts by President Trump. Conservative figures, including Senator Ted Cruz, Eric Trump and Sean Hannity, grew increasingly critical of the sites and beckoned followers to join them on Parler, whose investors include the right-wing activist and heiress Rebekah Mercer. The format was like Twitter’s, but with only two clear rules: no criminal activity and no spam or bots. On Parler, you could say what you wanted without being, as conservatives complained, “silenced.”After the election, as Trump sought to overturn his defeat with a barrage of false claims, Matze made a classic First Amendment argument for letting the disinformation stand: More speech is better. Let the marketplace of ideas run without interference. “If you don’t censor, if you don’t — you just let him do what he wants, then the public can judge for themselves,” Matze said of Trump’s Twitter account on the New York Times podcast “Sway.” “Just sit there and say: ‘Hey, that’s what he said. What do you guys think?’”Matze was speaking to the host of “Sway,” Kara Swisher, on Jan. 7 — the day after Trump told supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol and fight congressional certification of the Electoral College vote. In the chaos that followed Trump’s speech, the American marketplace of ideas clearly failed. Protecting democracy, for Trump loyalists, had become a cry to subvert and even destroy it. And while Americans’ freedoms of speech and the press were vital to exposing this assault, they were also among its causes. Right-wing media helped seed destabilizing lies; elected officials helped them grow; and the democratizing power of social media spread them, steadily, from one node to the next.Social media sites effectively function as the public square where people debate the issues of the day. But the platforms are actually more like privately owned malls: They make and enforce rules to keep their spaces tolerable, and unlike the government, they’re not obligated to provide all the freedom of speech offered by the First Amendment. Like the bouncers at a bar, they are free to boot anyone or anything they consider disruptive. In the days after Jan. 6, they swiftly cracked down on whole channels and accounts associated with the violence. Reddit removed the r/DonaldTrump subreddit. YouTube tightened its policy on posting videos that called the outcome of the election into doubt. TikTok took down posts with hashtags like #stormthecapitol. Facebook indefinitely suspended Trump’s account, and Twitter — which, like Facebook, had spent years making some exceptions to its rules for the president — took his account away permanently.Parler, true to its stated principles, did none of this. But it had a weak point: It was dependent on other private companies to operate. In the days after the Capitol assault, Apple and Google removed Parler from their app stores. Then Amazon Web Services stopped hosting Parler, effectively cutting off its plumbing. Parler sued, but it had agreed, in its contract, not to host content that “may be harmful to others”; having promised the streets of New York, it was actually bound by the rules of a kindergarten playground. In a court filing, Amazon provided samples of about 100 posts it had notified Parler were in violation of its contract in the weeks before the Capitol assault. “Fry ’em up,” one said, with a list of targets that included Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. “We are coming for you and you will know it.” On Jan. 21, a judge denied Parler’s demand to reinstate Amazon’s services.It’s unlikely the volume of incendiary content on Parler could rival that of Twitter or Facebook, where groups had openly planned for Jan. 6. But Parler is the one that went dark. A platform built to challenge the oligopoly of its giant rivals was deplatformed by other giants, in a demonstration of how easily they, too, could block speech at will.Over all, the deplatforming after Jan. 6 had the feeling of an emergency response to a wave of lies nearly drowning our democracy. For years, many tech companies had invoked the American ethos of free speech while letting disinformation and incitement spread abroad, even when it led to terrible violence. Now they leapt to action as if, with America in trouble, American ideals no longer applied. Parler eventually turned to overseas web-hosting services to get back online.“We couldn’t beat you in the war of ideas and discourse, so we’re pulling your mic” — that’s how Archon Fung, a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, put it, in expressing ambivalence about the moves. It seemed curiously easier to take on Trump and his allies in the wake of Democrats’ victories in the Senate runoffs in Georgia, giving them control of both chambers of Congress along with the White House. (Press officers for Twitter and Facebook said no election outcome influenced the companies’ decision.) And in setting an example that might be applied to the speech of the other groups — foreign dissidents, sex-worker activists, Black Lives Matter organizers — the deplatforming takes on an ominous cast.Fadi Quran, a campaign director for the global human rights group Avaaz, told me he, too, found the precedent worrying. “Although the steps may have been necessary to protect American lives against violence,” he said, “they are a reminder of the power big tech has over our information infrastructure. This infrastructure should be governed by deliberative democratic processes.”But what would those democratic processes be? Americans have a deep and abiding suspicion of letting the state regulate speech. At the moment, tech companies are filling the vacuum created by that fear. But do we really want to trust a handful of chief executives with policing spaces that have become essential parts of democratic discourse? We are uncomfortable with government doing it; we are uncomfortable with Silicon Valley doing it. But we are also uncomfortable with nobody doing it at all. This is a hard place to be — or, perhaps, two rocks and a hard place.When Twitter banned Trump, he found a seemingly unlikely defender: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who criticized the decision as a “problematic” breach of the right to free speech. This wasn’t necessarily because Merkel considered the content of Trump’s speech defensible. The deplatforming troubled her because it came from a private company; instead, she said through a spokesman, the United States should have a law restricting online incitement, like the one Germany passed in 2017 to prevent the dissemination of hate speech and fake news stories.Among democracies, the United States stands out for its faith that free speech is the right from which all other freedoms flow. European countries are more apt to fight destabilizing lies by balancing free speech with other rights. It’s an approach informed by the history of fascism and the memory of how propaganda, lies and the scapegoating of minorities can sweep authoritarian leaders to power. Many nations shield themselves from such anti-pluralistic ideas. In Canada, it’s a criminal offense to publicly incite hatred “against any identifiable group.” South Africa prosecutes people for uttering certain racial slurs. A number of countries in Europe treat Nazism as a unique evil, making it a crime to deny the Holocaust.In the United States, laws like these surely wouldn’t survive Supreme Court review, given the current understanding of the First Amendment — an understanding that comes out of our country’s history and our own brushes with suppressing dissent. The First Amendment did not prevent the administration of John Adams from prosecuting more than a dozen newspaper editors for seditious libel or the Socialist and labor leader Eugene V. Debs from being convicted of sedition over a speech, before a peaceful crowd, opposing involvement in World War I. In 1951, the Supreme Court upheld the convictions of Communist Party leaders for “conspiring” to advocate the overthrow of the government, though the evidence showed only that they had met to discuss their ideological beliefs.It wasn’t until the 1960s that the Supreme Court enduringly embraced the vision of the First Amendment expressed, decades earlier, in a dissent by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.: “The ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas.” In Brandenburg v. Ohio, that meant protecting the speech of a Ku Klux Klan leader at a 1964 rally, setting a high bar for punishing inflammatory words. Brandenburg “wildly overprotects free speech from any logical standpoint,” the University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone points out. “But the court learned from experience to guard against a worse evil: the government using its power to silence its enemies.”This era’s concept of free speech still differed from today’s in one crucial way: The court was willing to press private entities to ensure they allowed different voices to be heard. As another University of Chicago law professor, Genevieve Lakier, wrote in a law-review article last year, a hallmark of the 1960s was the court’s “sensitivity to the threat that economic, social and political inequality posed” to public debate. As a result, the court sometimes required private property owners, like TV broadcasters, to grant access to speakers they wanted to keep out.But the court shifted again, Lakier says, toward interpreting the First Amendment “as a grant of almost total freedom” for private owners to decide who could speak through their outlets. In 1974, it struck down a Florida law requiring newspapers that criticized the character of political candidates to offer them space to reply. Chief Justice Warren Burger, in his opinion for the majority, recognized that barriers to entry in the newspaper market meant this placed the power to shape public opinion “in few hands.” But in his view, there was little the government could do about it.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Traditionally, conservatives have favored that libertarian approach: Let owners decide how their property is used. That’s changing now that they find their speech running afoul of tech-company rules. “Listen to me, America, we were wiped out,” the right-wing podcaster Dan Bongino, an investor in Parler, said in a Fox News interview after Amazon pulled its services. “And to all the geniuses out there, too, saying this is a private company, it’s not a First Amendment fight — really, it’s not?” The law that prevents the government from censoring speech should still apply, he said, because “these companies are more powerful than a de facto government.” You needn’t sympathize with him to see the hit Parler took as the modern equivalent of, in Burger’s terms, disliking one newspaper and taking the trouble to start your own, only to find no one will sell you ink to print it.One problem with private companies’ holding the ability to deplatform any speaker is that they’re in no way insulated from politics — from accusations of bias to advertiser boycotts to employee walkouts. Facebook is a business, driven by profit and with no legal obligation to explain its decisions the way a court or regulatory body would. Why, for example, hasn’t Facebook suspended the accounts of other leaders who have used the platform to spread lies and bolster their power, like the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte? A spokesman said suspending Trump was “a response to a specific situation based on risk” — but so is every decision, and the risks can be just as high overseas.“It’s really media and public pressure that is the difference between Trump coming down and Duterte staying up,” says Evelyn Douek, a lecturer at Harvard Law School. “But the winds of public opinion are a terrible basis for free-speech decisions! Maybe it seems like it’s working right now. But in the longer run, how do you think unpopular dissidents and minorities will fare?”Deplatforming works, at least in the short term. There are indications that in the weeks after the platforms cleaned house — with Twitter suspending not just Trump but some 70,000 accounts, including many QAnon influencers — conversations about election fraud decreased significantly across several sites. After Facebook reintroduced a scoring system to promote news sources based on its judgment of their quality, the list of top performers, usually filled by hyperpartisan sources, featured CNN, NPR and local news outlets.But there’s no reason to think the healthier information climate will last. The very features that make social media so potent work both to the benefit and the detriment of democracy. YouTube, for instance, changed its recommendation algorithm in 2019, after researchers and reporters (including Kevin Roose at The New York Times) showed how it pushed some users toward radicalizing content. It’s also telling that, since the election, Facebook has stopped recommending civic groups for people to join. After Jan. 6, the researcher Aric Toler at Bellingcat surfaced a cheery video, automatically created by Facebook to promote its groups, which imposed the tagline “community means a lot” over images of a militia brandishing weapons and a photo of Robert Gieswein, who has since been charged in the assault on the Capitol. “I’m afraid that the technology has upended the possibility of a well-functioning, responsible speech environment,” the Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith says. “It used to be we had masses of speech in a reasonable range, and some extreme speech we could tolerate. Now we have a lot more extreme speech coming from lots of outlets and mouthpieces, and it’s more injurious and harder to regulate.”For decades, tech companies mostly responded to such criticism with proud free-speech absolutism. But external pressures, and the absence of any other force to contain users, gradually dragged them into the expensive and burdensome role of policing their domains. Facebook, for one, now has legions of low-paid workers reviewing posts flagged as harmful, a task gruesome enough that the company has agreed to pay $52 million in mental-health compensation to settle a lawsuit by more than 10,000 moderators.Perhaps because it’s so easy to question their motives, some executives have taken to begging for mercy. “We are facing something that feels impossible,” said Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, while being grilled by Congress last year. And Facebook’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has agreed with lawmakers that the company has too much power over speech. Two weeks after suspending Trump, Facebook said its new oversight board, an independent group of 20 international experts, would review the decision, with the power to make a binding ruling.Zuckerberg and Dorsey have also suggested openness to government regulation that would hold platforms to external standards. That might include, for example, requiring rules for slowing the spread of disinformation from known offenders. European lawmakers, with their more skeptical free-speech tradition (and lack of allegiance to American tech companies), have proposed requiring platforms to show how their recommendations work and giving users more control over them, as has been done in the realm of privacy. Steps like these seem better suited to combating misinformation than eliminating, as is often suggested, the immunity platforms currently enjoy from lawsuits, which directly affects only a narrow range of cases, mostly involving defamation.There is no consensus on a path forward, but there is precedent for some intervention. When radio and television radically altered the information landscape, Congress passed laws to foster competition, local control and public broadcasting. From the 1930s until the 1980s, anyone with a broadcast license had to operate in the “public interest” — and starting in 1949, that explicitly included exposing audiences to multiple points of view in policy debates. The court let the elected branches balance the rights of private ownership with the collective good of pluralism.This model coincided with relatively high levels of trust in media and low levels of political polarization. That arrangement has been rare in American history. It’s hard to imagine a return to it. But it’s worth remembering that radio and TV also induced fear and concern, and our democracy adapted and thrived. The First Amendment of the era aided us. The guarantee of free speech is for democracy; it is worth little, in the end, apart from it.</body>

	<title>Watchdog to Examine Whether Justice Dept. Helped Trump Effort to Overturn Election</title>
	<author>Katie Benner</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — The Justice Department watchdog announced Monday that he had opened an investigation into whether any of the department’s officials tried to undo the results of the presidential election, as scrutiny of former President Donald J. Trump and his associates builds ahead of his impeachment trial.The investigation by the department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, followed efforts by Mr. Trump and a top federal law enforcement official, Jeffrey Clark, to push other Justice Department leaders to falsely assert that continuing fraud investigations cast doubt on the election results. As detailed by The New York Times in recent days, Mr. Trump was said to have considered installing Mr. Clark as acting attorney general to carry out the scheme.“The inspector general is initiating an investigation into whether any former or current D.O.J. official engaged in an improper attempt to have D.O.J. seek to alter the outcome of the 2020 presidential election,” Mr. Horowitz said in a statement, adding that he was announcing the inquiry to reassure the public that the matter was being examined.The inquiry adds to the increasing scrutiny on Mr. Trump’s attempts to wield the power of the Justice Department to advance his false claims about the election in the final weeks of his presidency. It follows another inspector general investigation into whether a federal prosecutor in Georgia was improperly pushed to help and a broader Democratic-led Senate inquiry into pressure on the department to aid Mr. Trump’s cause.Mr. Trump sought repeatedly to compel the Justice Department to back his baseless claims of election irregularities, ultimately prompting the attorney general at the time, William P. Barr, to publicly state early last month that the department had found no voting fraud on a scale that would affect the election results. Mr. Barr fell out of favor with Mr. Trump over the issue and left his post within weeks.A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.The investigation underscores fears among Senate Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, that if they do not distance themselves from Mr. Trump and undo his grip on the party, a steady drip of negative revelations paired with his own erratic behavior could damage their political fortunes.“If Trump loses credibility because it appears he’s acted in a way that no one can justify, the leverage that he might have over the Republican Party could be diffused,” said William Marshall, a professor at the University of North Carolina who teaches and writes on presidential power. “The more that indicates he behaved improperly makes it less easy to defend him and less easy to stand by him.”Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, had urged Mr. Horowitz over the weekend to open an investigation, saying that it was “unconscionable that a Trump Justice Department leader would conspire to subvert the people’s will.”The inspector general also noted that his inquiry would be limited to the Justice Department because other agencies did not fall within his purview, a nod to the array of people who sought during Mr. Trump’s final weeks in office to find a way to stop the certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory.This month, Mr. Horowitz opened an investigation into whether Trump administration officials pressured Byung J. Pak, at the time the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, who abruptly resigned after it became clear to Mr. Trump that he would not take actions to cast doubt on or undo the results of the election, according to a person briefed on the inquiry.Separately, the Senate Judiciary Committee said this weekend that it had initiated its own oversight inquiry into officials including Mr. Clark, who was the head of the Justice Department’s environmental and natural resources division and the acting head of its civil division.Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the committee, sent a letter to the Justice Department saying that he would investigate efforts by Mr. Trump and Mr. Clark to use the agency “to further Trump’s efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election.”Mr. Durbin asked the acting attorney general, Monty Wilkinson, to preserve documents, emails and messages related to meetings between top Justice Department officials under Mr. Trump, the White House and Mr. Trump, as well as any communications related to Mr. Pak’s resignation.Mr. Biden’s win was deemed valid after recounts in Wisconsin and Georgia declared him the victor and after the Trump campaign team was unable to prove widespread fraud in court cases in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Dozens of F.B.I. investigations uncovered no voter fraud on a scale that would have changed the results of the election, according to Justice Department officials briefed on the cases.Dozens of Republicans in Congress were among those who backed Mr. Trump’s false claims, including Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania. On Monday, he confirmed a Times report that he had introduced Mr. Trump and Mr. Clark, giving the president access to the sole top Justice Department official willing to entertain the idea that Mr. Biden had not won the election.Mr. Perry, a member of the pro-Trump, hard-line Freedom Caucus, said in a statement to a Pennsylvania public radio affiliate that he spoke with Mr. Trump and Mr. Clark about election fraud claims.Numerous inquiries. Since former President Donald Trump left office, there have been many investigations and inquiries into his businesses and personal affairs. Here’s a list of those ongoing:Investigation into criminal fraud. The Manhattan district attorney’s office and the New York attorney general’s office have been investigating whether Mr. Trump or his family business, the Trump Organization, intentionally submitted false property values to potential lenders. In February, two Manhattan prosecutors resigned, clouding the future of the district attorney’s case.Investigation into tax evasion. As part of their investigation, in July 2021, the Manhattan district attorney’s office charged the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its chief financial officer, with orchestrating a 15-year scheme to evade taxes. In February, lawyers for both parties asked a judge to dismiss the charges.Investigation into election interference. The Atlanta district attorney is conducting a criminal investigation of election interference in Georgia by Mr. Trump and his allies.Investigation into the Trump National Golf Club. Prosecutors in the district attorney’s office in Westchester County, N.Y., appear to be focused at least in part on whether the Trump Organization misled local officials about the property’s value to reduce its taxes.Civil investigation into Trump Organization. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, is seeking to question Mr. Trump under oath in a civil fraud investigation of his business practices.“Throughout the past four years, I worked with Assistant Attorney General Clark on various legislative matters,” Mr. Perry said. “When President Trump asked if I would make an introduction, I obliged.”Allies of Mr. Clark have characterized the conversations as simply laying out the legal options available to Mr. Trump. But Mr. Clark’s former colleagues have said there were no more legal remedies that Mr. Trump could have pursued through the department.Still, their assessment did not stop Mr. Trump from pressuring the Justice Department to fight harder to find a way to help him. When Mr. Barr declined to appoint special counsels to examine voting irregularities or take other measures that would have helped to throw the election results into doubt, he and Mr. Trump agreed that he should leave the department, according to three people familiar with their conversation. Mr. Barr stipulated that the deputy attorney general at the time, Jeffrey A. Rosen, replace him, the people said.Mr. Trump began to push Mr. Rosen to promote baseless suspicions about voting fraud the day after announcing that Mr. Barr would leave and kept up the pressure through the last weeks of December, pushing him to open investigations and to challenge Mr. Biden’s win before the Supreme Court.But as the department’s top officials pushed back, Mr. Trump separately opened a line of communication with Mr. Clark, who seemed more amenable to his theory that he had won the election, according to five people familiar with the matter, asking him to publicize inquiries that could cast doubt on the election.Mr. Trump’s deliberations over whether to replace Mr. Rosen with Mr. Clark also set off a crisis among other senior Justice Department officials, who pledged to quit should Mr. Rosen be fired. The vow was said to have helped persuade Mr. Trump not to act.Mr. Clark has said that this account is inaccurate without specifying further and has said that all of his conduct was legal.While the machinations between Mr. Trump, Mr. Clark and Mr. Perry will not be the focus of Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial — which accuses him of inciting the riot at the Capitol — Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, suggested the matter would be presented to senators.“This is powerful motive evidence,” Mr. Swalwell said.</body>

	<title>Why Your TV Spies on You</title>
	<author>Shira Ovide</author>
	<body>This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.We are working, learning, staying in touch and being entertained through screens. But the companies that make those devices don’t have it easy. And that makes our virtual lives creepier and less fulfilling than they could be.It’s been true for years that for many companies, it’s tough to make money from selling smartphones, personal computers, television sets, streaming TV boxes like Roku and video game consoles. It takes a lot of expertise and cash to efficiently make complex electronics, and it’s a constant fight to beat competitors on price and catch shoppers’ attention.The dynamic creates two paths for the consumer electronics that many of us rely on. One is for gigantic companies to take over and crowd out everyone else. The other path is for companies to become money grubbing monsters. Either way, it’s not great for us.It was barely a blip for most of us, but last week the Korean electronics giant LG said it might stop making smartphones. LG was for a long time one of the top phone sellers in the world. Now it’s not. LG made many mistakes, and rivals like Apple, Samsung and Huawei overtook it.But it’s also true that there’s no room for relative minnows in many categories of consumer electronics. Not too long ago, there were still lots of companies making smartphones, PCs and some other categories of devices like fitness wearables. HTC gave up on smartphones. Sony mostly ditched PCs. Remember Jawbone? Dead. Fitbit is owned by Google now. These gadget categories and more only have room for whales.Consolidation is natural when any product goes from the hot new thing to mainstream. I promise you that I’m not nostalgic for old smartphone companies. (Well, maybe I’m still misty-eyed for Palm.) But I know that we lose something when companies with fresh ideas in gadgets have little chance and don’t bother to even try.And my bigger worry is that the difficulties of making it in hardware are nudging gadget sellers to do yucky things to us.Popular brands of TV sets keep track of what we’re watching and report it to companies that want to sell us new cars or credit cards. (Yeah, it’s gross.) One reason they do it is that selling personal information is pure profit, whereas selling you a TV set is definitely not. Roku also makes its real money not from selling its gizmos that connect our TVs to streaming apps, but from its side gigs including its  troves of information about what we watch that it uses to sell ads.You can think of these consumer electronics companies as basically Facebook that happens to sell us the screens, too. I don’t know about you, but that makes me feel less affectionate about my marathon sessions of “Cobra Kai.”Microsoft a few days ago announced — and then quickly backtracked on — a steep price increase for its Xbox online video game subscriptions. The price increase was a bone-headed move, but it also reflected the harsh reality: Selling Xbox video game consoles generates relatively slim profits for Microsoft. Add-ons like online subscriptions are more profitable.I don’t want to exaggerate what’s happening. In some areas of consumer electronics, there are still plenty of new ideas flourishing. Don’t shed any tears for Apple and its piles of cash. But mostly, hardware is hard. And that makes things tougher on us, too, at a time when we need our gadgets more than ever.TIP OF THE WEEKBrian X. Chen, the personal technology columnist for The New York Times, tells us the essential apps to download now.The most downloaded apps today include TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Netflix. Left off the most popular lists are a few staples that every smartphone needs. Here are my top three:1. A password manager. The rule of thumb is that each password you use should be unique and complex. But it’s impossible to do that and remember them all.Password-management apps like 1Password and LastPass solve this problem. They let you store all your passwords in a digital vault that can be unlocked with one master password. In other words, you only need to memorize one password. The apps also include tools to automatically generate complex passwords for you.2. An ad blocker. Many online ads are loaded with scripts that collect your personal information and suck up your phone battery; some even contain links to malware. Until the ad industry comes up with a better way, our best bet is using an ad blocking app like 1Blocker to prevent ads from loading in the web browser.Some see ad blockers as problematic because they can drain revenue from websites. But many of the apps let people select their favorite sites and unblock those ads. (For Android users: Google doesn’t allow ad blockers to be downloaded through its app store. To install the apps you will need to use a method known as sideloading.)3. An encrypted messaging app. Our online conversations should be no one else’s business. That makes encrypted messaging crucial.Here’s how it works: When you send a message, it becomes scrambled so that it is indecipherable to anyone but the intended recipient.If anyone else, including a government agency, wants to see your messages, no one — including the app provider itself — can get access to the unscrambled messages. For years, my favorite encrypted messaging app has been Signal because of its excellent privacy safeguards.The largest unionization effort at Amazon: Workers at a company warehouse in Alabama are scheduled to vote next month on whether to unionize. My colleagues Michael Corkery and Karen Weise detail what both Amazon and some of its employees want, and how this union campaign is connected to poultry processing plant workers.Getting more children online fast: New York officials said it would be “impossible” to quickly install Wi-Fi in homeless shelters for students to participate in online classes. Some shelter operators have proved them wrong with imperfect but functional internet gear, The Times’s Andy Newman writes.Black, deaf and extremely online: On TikTok and other apps, young people are drawing attention to Black American Sign Language, a variation of ASL that scholars say has long been overlooked, writes my colleague Allyson Waller.Baby owls! In a bucket! Don’t miss the little ones that need a nudge on the rump. (Thanks to my colleague Sandra E. Garcia for tweeting this.)We want to hear from you.

	<title>‘Mike Nichols’ Captures a Star-Studded Life That Shuttled Between Broadway and Hollywood</title>
	<author>Dwight Garner</author>
	<body>When the writer and director Mike Nichols was young, he had an allergic reaction to a whooping cough vaccine. The result was a complete and lifelong inability to grow hair. One way to read Mark Harris’s crisp new biography, “Mike Nichols: A Life,” is as a tender comedy about a man and his wigs.He got his first set (hair, eyebrows) before he went to college. It was dismal. Nichols attended the University of Chicago, where Susan Sontag was also a student. One reason they didn’t date, Harris writes, is that “she was thrown off by his wig.”Nichols moved to Manhattan to make it as a comedian. A friend said that she would enter his tiny apartment and “the smell of acetone” — wig-glue remover — “would just hit you in the face.”Nichols found fame in his mid-20s. His improvisational comedy routines with Elaine May, whom he’d met in Chicago, were fresh and irresistible. They took their act to Broadway in 1960, where Nichols met Richard Burton. Through Burton, he would get to know Elizabeth Taylor.On the set of “Cleopatra,” Taylor asked the production’s hairstyle designer, “Do you do personal wigs? Because I have a dear friend who’s a comic in New York, and he wears one of the worst wigs I’ve ever seen.” Before long, Nichols’s toupees were unrivaled.“It takes me three hours every morning to become Mike Nichols,” he told the actor George Segal. He had a sense of humor about it all. He would tell how his son, Max, crawled into bed beside him and, seeing only the back of his head, screamed, “Where’s Daddy’s face?”I’ve gone on too long about hair and the lack of it. But growing up bald was, Nichols’s brother said, “the defining aspect of his childhood.”Nichols’s gift as a director was his ability to locate and lightly tug on the details that make a character. If he’d made a movie of his own life, the wig scenes would have been superb — satirical and melancholy. He might have set a bathroom-mirror montage to the Beatles’ early cover of “Lend Me Your Comb.”His awkwardness made him watchful. He became a student of human behavior. When he finally got the chance to direct, it was as if he’d been preparing to do so his entire life.Nichols’s first two films were “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “The Graduate” — the first furious, daring and adult, the second zeitgeist-defining. He directed four consecutive hit plays at nearly the same moment. Oscars, Tony Awards and a landslide of wealth followed.He made up for his time as an outsider with a vengeance. He collected Arabian horses and Picassos and began friendships with Jacqueline Kennedy, Leonard Bernstein and Richard Avedon. He was a cocky princeling who became a master of what Kenneth Clark liked to call the “swimgloat,” a way of moving through elite society as if on a barge made of silver and silk.Nichols was born Michael Igor Peschkowsky (or Igor Michael, it’s unclear) in Berlin in 1931. His father, a doctor, was a Russian Jew who changed the family name to Nichols after the family emigrated to the United States in the late 1930s. The family had some money, and Nichols’s father’s patients in New York included the pianist Vladimir Horowitz. Nichols attended good schools in Manhattan, including Dalton.At the University of Chicago he became an omnivorous reader and watcher of films. His wit was withering; people were terrified of him. May’s wit was even more devastating. They were made for each other. They were never really a romantic couple, Harris writes, though early on they may have slept together once or twice.Harris is the author of two previous books, “Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood” and “Five Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War.” He’s also a longtime entertainment reporter with a gift for scene-setting.He’s at his best in “Mike Nichols: A Life” when he takes you inside a production. His chapters on the making of three films in particular — “The Graduate,” “Silkwood” and “Angels in America” — are miraculous: shrewd, tight, intimate and funny. You sense he could turn each one into a book.Nichols was an actor’s director. He was avuncular, a charmer, wide in his human sympathies. He tried to find what an actor needed and to provide it. He could place a well-buffed fingernail on a tick that wanted to be a tock. But he had a steely side.He fired Gene Hackman during week one on “The Graduate.” Hackman was playing Mr. Robinson and it wasn’t working, in part because, at 37, he looked too young for the role.Sacrificing someone early could be a motivator for the remaining cast, he learned. He fired Mandy Patinkin early in the filming of “Heartburn,” and brought in Jack Nicholson to play Meryl Streep’s faithless husband.One reason the chapter on Nichols’s film of Tony Kushner’s play “Angels in America” is so rich is that Harris, who is married to Kushner, had access to the playwright’s diary.Nichols turned to projects like “Angels in America” to shore up his serious side. But in everything he did, he found the funny. He knew instinctively that tragedy appeals mainly to the emotions while comedy taps the mind.Nichols presided over a lot of muck, expensive flops like “The Day of the Dolphin,” with George C. Scott; “The Fortune,” with Nicholson and Warren Beatty; and “What Planet Are You From?” with Garry Shandling. Reading Harris’s accounts of making these films is like watching a cook strain his stock down the disposal.Nichols’s critical flops in the theater included an Off Broadway production of “Waiting for Godot” with Steve Martin and Robin Williams. His failures rattled him. He battled depression (one of his vanity license plates read “ANOMIE”) and had suicidal urges after being placed on Halcion, a benzodiazepine. He had, Harris writes, “an almost punitive need to prove his detractors wrong.”He had a manic side. He snorted his share of cocaine and, for a while in the 1980s, used crack. You imagine him on the latter, racing back and forth from film set to Broadway as if through a set of constantly swinging cat doors.Harris details his subject’s many collaborations with Streep, and with Nora Ephron. Nichols was married four times. His final marriage, to Diane Sawyer, was the one that lasted.Nichols was a hard man to get to know, and I’m not sure we understand him much better at the end of “Mike Nichols: A Life.” He was a man in perpetual motion, and Harris chases him with patience, clarity and care.</body>

	<title>Dissidents First: A Foreign Policy Doctrine for the Biden Administration</title>
	<author>Bret Stephens</author>
	<body>Thirty years from now, what will historians consider the most consequential event of January 2021 — the storming of the U.S. Capitol by an insurrectionist mob, or Aleksei Navalny’s heroic return to Moscow, followed by his immediate arrest?In a broad sense, the two events are about the same thing: the future of freedom. In one version of the future, the assault on the Capitol marks the point at which the forces of illiberalism, mob violence and disinformation, much of it stoked and financed by the Russian government, reached critical mass in the West. In another version, the assault will be remembered as a historical anomaly when compared with the recovery of freedom in places where it once seemed lost — not just Russia but also China, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela.How can Joe Biden move history toward the second version? By pursuing a foreign policy that puts dissidents first.A common view of dissidents is that they are a humanitarian problem, but one that gets in the way of more important issues. Hillary Clinton gave voice to this view when, on her way to Beijing as secretary of state in 2009, she insisted that human rights questions “can’t interfere with the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis and the security crisis.” This isn’t cynicism, but rather a version of the utilitarian idea that doing the greatest good for the greatest number always takes precedence over the immediate interests of a handful of people.But that’s wrong, and not just philosophically. Dissidents matter to the U.S. strategically. The dictatorships that most threaten the free world are too powerful to be brought down militarily. Nor are they likely to moderate their behavior thanks to economic prosperity or reformers working within the system. Anyone in doubt on this score need only look at China’s recent trajectory as an ever richer and ever more repressive regime.What can bring dictatorships down is a credible domestic opposition that galvanizes public indignation through acts of exposure, mockery and heroic defiance. That defiance highlights the hypocrisies of the regime while demonstrating the possibilities of challenging it.International pressure alone was not sufficient to bring down the apartheid government in South Africa. It took Nelson Mandela. Economic decay alone was not sufficient to bring down the Communist regimes in Poland and Czechoslovakia. It took Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel. The Soviet Union might be standing today had it not been for Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov and Natan Sharansky.What is happening to Navalny is of a piece with that history. After barely surviving a brazen assassination attempt in August, Navalny duped one of his alleged would-be killers and extracted an unwitting confession. He followed up with an investigative video on the lavish lifestyle of Russian President Vladimir Putin, complete with a billion-dollar palace on the Black Sea, that’s been viewed north of 70 million times.That Putin felt compelled to publicly deny owning the palace — while facing nationwide protests over Navalny’s arrest — is a reminder of how much more he has to fear from one man with courage than from any other form of pressure. A dissident is to a dictatorship what a bald fact is to an edifice of lies, the revelation of which causes the whole thing to crumble.What’s true of Navalny in Russia is true of Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong in Hong Kong. It’s true of Ilham Tohti and Xu Zhiyong in mainland China. It’s true of Nasrin Sotoudeh and Alireza Alinejad in Iran. It’s true of José Daniel Ferrer in Cuba and Leopoldo López of Venezuela. Those, among many others, are names that should mean something to any reader of The Times who cares about the recovery of freedom in the world.These should also be names that President Biden, his secretary of state nominee, Antony Blinken, and his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, should make inextricable parts of American statecraft. Should China want U.S. tariffs eased? Negotiable — but not while Lai faces trial and Tohti is in prison. Would Russia like to see U.S. sanctions eased on Kremlin-favored oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska? Conceivable — but not while Navalny is under arrest and has to fear for his life. Would Iran like to resume nuclear negotiations? Then let Sotoudeh, Alinejad and every other political case in Evin Prison go.In that connection, it beggars belief that the White House is reportedly considering former diplomat Robert Malley as a special envoy for Iran. Malley is widely seen as one of Tehran’s premier apologists in Washington; in November 2019 he went so far as to suggest that massive public protests in Iran justified Tehran’s paranoia about an Israeli-Saudi-U.S. plot. A Malley appointment would signal that, on the things that matter most, Biden’s foreign policy will be coldly transactional.It needn’t be that way. A dissidents-first foreign policy would immediately revive America’s moral leadership after its squandering under Trump. It would force our adversaries to choose between their material interests and their habits of repression. And it would provide a margin of safety and maneuver for the dissidents we’d one day like to see in power. As foreign policy doctrines go, it’s more than decent. It’s smart.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

	<title>Biden’s Commerce Pick Vows to Combat China and Climate Change</title>
	<author>Ana Swanson</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Gina M. Raimondo, President Biden’s nominee to be the next commerce secretary, told lawmakers on Tuesday that she planned to help American communities bounce back from coronavirus, aggressively enforce trade rules to combat unfair Chinese practices and leverage the government’s power to mitigate climate change if confirmed.Ms. Raimondo, the current governor of Rhode Island and a former venture capitalist, tried to reassure members of the Senate Commerce Committee that she would work with them on priorities like protecting American fisheries, expanding broadband access and promoting American research into cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced communications.“In this time of overlapping crises, the Commerce Department must be a partner to businesses and workers to help them innovate and grow,” Ms. Raimondo said.The Commerce Department has become increasingly powerful in recent years, given its wide-ranging authority over technology exports, climate change and other issues. Sometimes described as the government’s hall closet, the sprawling department is also responsible for enforcing trade rules, monitoring the weather and carrying out the census.The Trump administration made heavy use of the department’s authorities to crack down on Chinese technology firms, turning often to the so-called entity list, which allows the United States to block companies from selling American products and technology to certain foreign firms without first obtaining a license. Dozens of companies have been added to the Commerce Department’s list, including telecom giants like Huawei and ZTE, which many American lawmakers see as threats to national security.While lawmakers from both parties have flagged some Chinese companies as national security risks, Ms. Raimondo declined to commit to keeping Huawei or other Chinese firms on the entity list when pressed to do so by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. She vowed to use the powers of the Commerce Department “to protect Americans and our network from Chinese interference,” adding, “that’s Huawei, ZTE, or any other company.”The Biden administration is facing pressure from industry to relax some of the tight controls imposed on China by the Trump administration. On Monday, a semiconductor manufacturing group sent a letter to Ms. Raimondo urging her to review export controls that they said were harming the industry, and to impose multilateral controls in concert with allies instead.Ms. Raimondo called China’s actions “anti-competitive, hurtful to American workers and businesses” and said the country was “culpable for atrocious human rights abuses.”But her reluctance to explicitly commit to keeping certain Chinese companies on the entity list drew a sharp rebuke from some Republicans, including Mr. Cruz.“There’s chatter in Washington that the Biden administration is contemplating going easy on China and removing companies from the entities list,” Mr. Cruz said during the hearing. “I certainly hope that does not happen because I think that would be profoundly contrary to the national security interest of the United States.”In a tweet on Tuesday, Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, said removing Huawei from the entity list would be a mistake, given the company’s links to the Chinese military and the threat it poses to American security.“It’s remarkable and frankly disturbing that Ms. Raimondo can’t commit to keeping #Huawei on the Entity List,” he said. “I strongly urge her to reconsider.”Ms. Raimondo also appeared to walk a careful line on the steel and aluminum tariffs that President Donald J. Trump levied on foreign countries, including many in Europe.She declined to say whether the Biden administration would remove or change the metal tariffs, instead committing it to carrying out a broad review of trade policies in consultation with its allies and pursuing uncompetitive trade behavior from China. She also pledged to ensure that the process that allows certain companies to avoid the steel and aluminum tariffs — which faced criticism during the Trump administration for being complicated and arbitrary — was swift, fair and objective.In a sign of how broad a portfolio she would be overseeing, Ms. Raimondo vowed to focus on a wide range of other issues, including promoting the country’s capacity in advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain and 5G telecommunications, and making broadband access, particularly in rural areas and tribal lands, “a very top priority the minute I get into the job.”She described internet access as a “necessity” in the pandemic, pointing to how it allows children to take online classes, patients to visit with their doctors and people to sign up to receive the coronavirus vaccine.“It’s not a luxury good,” she said. “Everybody deserves access to broadband.”Several senators praised her combination of public and private sector experience, saying those skills could help the country deal with economic damage from the pandemic, increase investment in American workers and business, and promote the marine and space economies, which the Commerce Department also oversees.Ms. Raimondo said that her background as a state official and a venture capitalist before that had prepared her to help realize the department’s mission. She talked about the effects of offshoring and factory closures on her family in the 1980s, when her father lost his job at a local watch factory and was forced into early retirement.During the hearing, Ms. Raimondo focused on her role in bringing down Rhode Island’s unemployment rate, once the highest in the nation, crediting work force training and small business lending programs that she helped initiate. Rhode Island’s unemployment rate sat at 6.6 percent when Ms. Raimondo took office as governor in 2015. It then fell fairly steadily to a low of 3.4 percent at the beginning of 2020, mirroring a broader trend around the United States. The jobless rate has since spiked in the wake of the pandemic, and in November it sat at 7.3 percent, the 12th highest of any state in the nation.</body>

	<title>Bolsonaro Talked Vaccines Down. Now Brazil Has Too Few Doses.</title>
	<author>Letícia Casado</author>
	<body>RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil on Monday kicked off its nationwide coronavirus vaccination campaign, providing a glimmer of hope in a nation where political infighting, a strained health care system and lax precautions have given the virus free rein.But the rollout is expected to be painfully slow, even as Brazil battles two worrisome new variants of the virus, at least one of which is more contagious and could be contributing to the country’s recent surge of cases.The government is scrambling to buy more vaccine after months of taking a lackadaisical approach, as President Jair Bolsonaro argued that scientists and the media were hyping the seriousness of a virus that has killed more than 210,000 Brazilians. The country now has just six million doses of vaccine on hand for a nation of 213 million people.The potential menace of the new variants became clear last week as patients in the northern state of Amazonas asphyxiated to death because hospitals ran out of oxygen amid a sharp rise in critically ill patients. Prosecutors investigating the calamity said at least 16 patients had died.The oxygen shortage “is the saddest and most outrageous expression of the government’s abject failure at all levels,” Alex Machado Campos, a director of the country’s health regulatory agency said in televised remarks Sunday. “Is this a civilized nation or one living through a barbaric dystopia?”The lack of vaccine doses is just one of myriad missteps that have hampered the country’s ability to protect its people against the pandemic. Mr. Bolsonaro has been criticized for repeatedly downplaying the threat of the virus, promoting a useless treatment, refusing to wear a mask, sabotaging other officials’ lockdown measures and, most recently, fueling unfounded fears about the safety of vaccines.Last month, the president, who had Covid-19 and recovered, said he had no intention of getting a vaccine and criticized vaccine providers for asking buyers to sign hold-harmless agreements.“It’s quite clear in the contract: they take no responsibility for any collateral effect,” Mr. Bolsonaro said, taking aim at the American drug company Pfizer. “If you turn into a crocodile, that’s your problem.”After peaking in July, when Brazil regularly had 1,200 coronavirus deaths per day, cases and fatalities dropped gradually for a few months, but began to inch up in November. In recent weeks, the country has often reported more than 1,000 deaths a day, and Brazil’s death toll is second only to that in the United States.Brazilian scientists say the new variants discovered in Brazil could be contributing to the resurgence of the virus. The one in Amazonas contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness. (Both variants have another mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines.)The two mutated viruses have slipped the country’s borders and turned up in other parts of the world, with the latest discovery occurring in South Korea.While virus mutations are common, experts say hard-hit countries like Brazil provide fertile ground for new variants that could hamper the global response. Despite a rise in cases, bars and restaurants are doing brisk business and mask wearing is spotty.“The appearance of these variants is directly proportional to people’s lack of care,” said Luiz Vicente Rizzo, the head of research at Israeli Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo.Pedro Hallal, a Harvard-trained epidemiologist who led a study on the evolution of the virus in Brazil at the Federal University of Pelotas, said the drastic surge of cases in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, suggests that the new strain there is likely more contagious.“I am not someone who believes in coincidences,” Mr. Hallal said. “Our new variant was found in Manaus and now cases are booming. It’s improbable that there isn’t a correlation between one thing and the other.”Brazilian scientists say they are working around the clock to have a more complete picture of the prevalence of new variants, but labs have limited capacity to sequence virus genomes compared to their counterparts in countries like the United States and Britain.“With the resources and the funds we have at this moment in the country, we are doing the best we can,” said Paola Resende, a virologist at Rio de Janeiro’s Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses and Measles.Reports of the variants in Brazil have raised alarm abroad. Officials in Japan reported last week that they had diagnosed cases of the new variant in four passengers who arrived in Tokyo after traveling from Manaus.Citing concern over the new Brazilian variants, Britain last week banned flights from Latin America and Portugal. Italy later suspended its few remaining flights to Brazil.Health experts had hoped Brazil would be among the earliest countries to mount a swift and efficient vaccination campaign, given the country’s strong track record on immunization efforts. But the rollout has been chaotic and bitterly politicized.Health minister Eduardo Pazuello last week announced he would travel to India to personally pick up two million doses of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University that India has been allowed to manufacture. But in an embarrassing setback, the flight was scuttled at the last minute after officials in India, who were about to launch their own vaccination program, told the Brazilian government they didn’t yet have doses to spare.The attempted purchase from India appeared to be a bid by Mr. Bolsonaro’s government to outflank one of his political rivals, São Paulo Governor João Doria. Mr. Doria, who has championed the vaccine produced by China’s Sinovac, had procured a few million doses of that vaccine even before his country’s health regulators approved it on Sunday.The Sinovac purchase came as part of an agreement to allow China to test the vaccine in Brazil, in conjunction with a São Paulo-based research institute. While there is some relief that Brazil has any vaccine on hand, the efficacy rate of that vaccine, CoronaVac, turned out to be just over 50 percent, far less than other inoculations.Mr. Doria took aim at the Bolsonaro government on Sunday as he presided over an event in São Paulo where the first handful of health care workers received shots. The nationwide campaign began a day later.“The vaccine is a lesson for you, authoritarians who disregard life, who lack compassion,” he said.Mr. Pazuello, an Army general, responded angrily, accusing Mr. Doria of turning the vaccine rollout into a “marketing play” to boost his political standing. Mr. Doria is widely expected to run for president next year.Despite Mr. Bolsonaro’s antipathy toward CoronaVac — he has called Chinese products untrustworthy — the health ministry demanded that Mr. Doria turn over his supply of the vaccine to the federal government for use across the country. The governor acquiesced, though he kept some for his state.The federal government has established priority groups for the vaccine, but officials have yet to provide a detailed plan that outlines when certain groups will be vaccinated and how many doses of which vaccines the country intends to obtain.On Monday, Mr. Bolsonaro said Brazil would purchase vaccines as they become “available in the market.”Mr. Pazuello, meanwhile, has been faulted for failing to anticipate the oxygen crisis in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, which sparked a chaotic evacuation of patients, including some premature babies, to other states.From Thursday through Sunday, 312 people died from Covid-19 in Amazonas, a toll 50 percent higher than in the proceeding four days.Amazonas Governor Wilson Lima said his team had warned that hospitals were running dangerously low on oxygen days before patients began asphyxiating. “We weren’t able to get what we needed,” he said in an interview.With patients in distress, officials in Manaus got oxygen tanks from neighboring Venezuela giving its authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro, a public relations victory against Mr. Bolsonaro, a nemesis. The failure to have enough oxygen on hand is now being investigated by the Supreme Court.The health ministry did not respond to emailed questions about the situation in Manaus.David Luniere, a doctor in Manaus, compared the frenzied scenes of triage in his hospital to treating patients in a war zone. When a woman whose father died in his care thanked him profusely for his efforts, Dr. Luniere felt gutted.“She told me she knew I had done everything I could do for her father,” he said. “I know I didn’t do everything I can because I couldn’t.”</body>

	<title>Telegram, Pro-Democracy Tool, Struggles Over New Fans From Far Right</title>
	<author>Michael Schwirtz</author>
	<body>The messaging app Telegram has long been an engine of resistance and an annoyance for tyrants. Authoritarian leaders in Russia and Iran have tried to ban it. When protests broke out recently in Belarus and Hong Kong, Telegram was the glue that held democracy movements together in the face of violent onslaughts by powerful security services.These days, though, Telegram is quickly becoming an online refuge for a different kind of resistance.Far-right conspiracy theorists, racists and violent insurrectionists have been flocking to Telegram in recent weeks after being banished from the big American social media platforms following the storming of the Capitol building in Washington by a mob supporting President Donald J. Trump, who himself was cut off from Facebook and Twitter.Twenty-five million new users flooded Telegram in the days after Twitter and Facebook, reacting to the Jan. 6 mayhem at the Capitol, purged users they deemed responsible for having incited violence or spread disinformation. The company’s founder, Pavel Durov, described it as “the largest digital migration in human history.”The cascade of new users presents a new complication for Mr. Durov, who has positioned himself as an unambiguous ally of the street and free speech. He has promoted Telegram, which combines the features of Facebook and Twitter with encrypted messaging and a hands-off moderating philosophy, as a refuge for the oppressed.With Washington and the rest of the United States on high alert after the Capitol violence, some fear that the features that make Telegram a popular tool for organizing resistance to authoritarian regimes could be used by the far right and extreme supporters of Mr. Trump to cause further mayhem. Already the F.B.I. has warned police chiefs across the country to be on the lookout for potential attacks by armed militia groups and racist extremists.“There’s a real push and pull between the people that are using Telegram — and messengers like it — for good, and the people who are using them to undermine democracy,” said Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation analyst at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research group. “We see the same openness and sense of connection that is used by democratic activists opportunistically exploited by extremists.”Mr. Durov initially welcomed the influx of users and criticized the big American competitors for the expulsions, suggesting they were an effort to limit free speech. Last Monday, though, Mr. Durov announced that his team had blocked hundreds of posts from American channels calling for violence ahead of the presidential inauguration.“For the last two weeks, the world has been following the events in the United States with concern,” Mr. Durov said in a post on his own Telegram channel. “While the US represents less than 2% of our user base, we at Telegram have also been watching the situation closely.”Mr. Durov said that 94 percent of Telegram’s 25 million new users came from Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa.Some have come to Telegram out of privacy fears after WhatsApp informed its customers that it was sharing information with its parent company, Facebook.But many were refugees who had recently been banished from other services for posting extremist, insurrectionist views. The Proud Boys, a far-right militant group, directed new followers to chat groups on Telegram, and established right-wing accounts saw significant spikes in membership.The platform got a boost on the right when Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, sent a message to his followers singing Telegram’s praises.“Welcome, newcomers, to the darkest part of the web,” Mr. Tarrio wrote in a Telegram message. “You can be banned for spamming and porn. Everything else is fair game.”It is not the first time Telegram has had to contend with unsavory characters taking advantage of the same features that draw in democracy activists. After a similar crackdown by Twitter on Islamist radicals a few years ago, the Islamic State migrated to Telegram and used it to orchestrate terrorist attacks, spread propaganda and find recruits.Several attacks in France were carried out by Islamic State militants who used Telegram’s encrypted chat function to coordinate their actions. When the French authorities sought information about the attackers from Mr. Durov, he replied that secrecy protocols made getting user information impossible, even for Telegram employees.Mr. Durov, an extreme libertarian who is often described as Russia’s Mark Zuckerberg, has for years faced off against the Kremlin’s efforts to silence him in his native Russia and now lives in self-imposed exile. He founded Telegram with his brother in 2013 as a digital outpost of free speech after the Kremlin stripped him of control over Vkontakte, a popular social media site he created as a Russian version of Facebook.Telegram has no ads or outside investors and is funded almost entirely through Mr. Durov’s personal fortune. It is hosted on multiple servers spread around the world, ensuring that no one government can exercise total control over the service or gain access to information about its users.“Telegram has never yielded to pressure from officials who wanted us to perform political censorship,” Mr. Durov wrote in an online missive a few years ago.As a resistance tool, it acts as a kind of social media Swiss Army knife, with a newsfeed similar to Facebook’s or Twitter’s for sharing uncensored information as well as an encrypted messenger service for secret communications.Last August, when presidential election returns began to show that Belarus’s longtime dictator, Aleksandr Lukashenko, might have lost, his government quickly shut down the country’s communications infrastructure, targeting social media applications like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook.Telegram, too, faltered at first. But Mr. Durov quickly intervened, enabling what he called “anti-censorship tools” to keep Telegram running, probably including what is known as domain fronting, which disguises the source of online traffic.After Mr. Lukashenko declared victory and protesters poured into the streets, Telegram was a source of uninterrupted information and a platform for organizing resistance. The Telegram channel for Nexta, a news service run by Belarusian exiles in neighboring Poland, began providing logistical support for its two million local followers, interspersing videos of a police crackdown on protesters with instructions about, and march routes for, daily demonstrations.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.“For three days the internet was shut down in Belarus, and no one in the world knew what was going on,” Stepan Svetlov, who runs Nexta, said. “The only source of information was Telegram.”In Iran, where Telegram usage takes up 60 percent of the country’s internet bandwidth, the app was a crucial platform for organizing and spreading antigovernment protests in 2017 and 2019. It enabled protesters to share videos of violent crackdowns when journalists and cameras were banned.The Iranian government tried to ban the app in 2018, but it made little difference. Iranians just used VPN networks to circumvent the government blockage.“It’s a hole in the censorship walls of the Islamic Republic,” said Omid Memarian, an independent analyst on human rights and technology in Iran. “It is the dominant way to stay informed and connected and to organize. Everyone uses it, even grandparents who don’t typically navigate technology,” he said.Mr. Durov’s attitude toward law enforcement has caused him trouble in his native Russia. In 2018, a Moscow court granted Russia’s communications oversight agency the authority to block Telegram after Mr. Durov refused to give the F.S.B., the country’s powerful domestic intelligence agency, access to users’ encrypted messages.The ban was short-lived though, and because Telegram is not reliant on servers in Russia, largely ineffective. The ban was lifted last year in a decision welcomed not only by the Kremlin’s opponents, but by the country’s top officials, who now seem to take a kind of patriotic pride in Telegram’s Russian origins.Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, uses it. So do many of Russia’s top propagandists, including Margarita Simonyan, who informed her followers this month that she planned to move all her communications to Telegram exclusively. The only exceptions, she joked, were the two assassins behind the 2018 poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, who famously claimed in an interview with Ms. Simonyan to be sports nutritionists and not intelligence officers.Shortly after Twitter blocked Mr. Trump’s account, Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, urged the president to move over to Telegram as well.“Seems like you don’t enjoy freedom of speech in your own country any more!” Mr. Polyanskiy wrote.So far, Mr. Trump has refrained, though a fake account created in his name already has nearly 800,000 subscribers.On Friday his son, Donald Trump Jr., announced that he had joined Telegram and urged supporters to follow his channel.“Big Tech Censorship is getting worse and if these Tyrants banned my father, the President of the United States, who won’t they ban?” he wrote on Twitter. “We need a place that I can connect to you guys that represents Free Speech. That’s why I joined Telegram.”Farnaz Fassihi contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Cooks Turned Instagram Into the World’s Greatest Takeout Menu</title>
	<author>Tejal Rao</author>
	<body>LOS ANGELES — Working as a cook at Rustic Canyon in Santa Monica, Calif., Jihee Kim made dimpled, tender malfatti, and green pozole bobbing with mussels and clams. But all the while, she dreamed about opening her own place.It would be like her favorite banchan shops in Busan, South Korea, where she grew up. Ms. Kim would sell starchy Japanese yams braised in soy sauce, delicate omelets rolled into perfect spirals with seaweed, and cucumber fermented with sweet Korean pears.It was just a dream — until last year, when the pandemic forced restaurants to shut down, and a wave of unemployed, entrepreneurial cooks started to rethink their careers and reshape the takeout scenes in their cities with new, homegrown food businesses.Ms. Kim joined a wave of restaurant cooks all over the country, improvising new pop-ups, advertising their menus on Instagram and changing the way so many diners order food.It’s more unpredictable, and more chaotic. I have calendar alerts set up for more than 50 menu drops on Instagram, and notifications set for new posts on about 100 accounts. It’s worth it for the smoky cochinita pibil from Alan Cruz; candy-topped, triple-layered citrus cakes made by Sasha Piligian; and oxtail patties from Rashida Holmes.Though I sometimes miss out on a spot, or a special, I also find my way to others. And a capricious algorithm points me to pop-ups all over the country, from Jessica and Trina Quinn’s plump pelmeni in Brooklyn, to Anwar Herron’s craggy fried chicken in Napa.When Instagram introduced Shop and Reels tabs to its home page last November, prioritizing popular brands and influencers, I worried that the platform would become more hostile to tiny food pop-ups. But cooks made it work, relying on direct messages or linking out to forms, custom-built shopping pages or third-party apps.This kind of decentralized ordering process can be disorienting for diners. It’s on you to follow each business closely, to remember each pop-up’s schedule, pickup rules and payment methods, and some cooks are better organized than others. Information trickles out in a mix of stories that disappear after 24 hours, and posts, and it can change week to week.Despite this, and the fact that most pop-ups are unregulated by health departments, Instagram has become one of my favorite takeout menus. Perilla, Ms. Kim’s pickup-only pop-up, illustrates why.Ms. Kim, 34, started Perilla last May out of her apartment in Koreatown, Los Angeles. Like all diners, I ordered the food online and never went inside, but I found the experience revitalizing and intimate — the same person who bought all the produce at the farmers’ market also prepped and cooked all the food. That same person took my order, packed it up carefully and delivered it to me in my car.Throughout the process, there was a sense of trust, and a feeling of closeness to Ms. Kim’s kitchen.“Hi, are you eating the bulgogi right now, or later?” she asked me over the phone, when I pulled up — a little late. “Because if you’re eating it now, I want to warm it up for you!”As Ms. Kim got busier, she shifted operations to a friend’s unfinished restaurant space, which functions as a kind of cloud kitchen — a restaurant without a dining room. She brought in a few portable butane stoves and induction burners to handle the cooking, and her friend and fellow cook Sara Kang started helping out.The setup may be scrappy — no ovens, no dining tables, no investors, no employees — but Ms. Kim’s food is not.Ms. Kim works with whatever looks good at the farmers’ market when she goes, whether it’s a classic Korean pairing of cabbage and kombu, or a less traditional one of celery root and mushrooms. It’s delicious, beautifully presented and travels well, and it’s a thrill to have access to it every week.This surge of new pop-ups can seem like a bright spot as restaurants struggle, or close, but the pandemic didn’t exactly create opportunities for cooks — in many ways, it made them harder to come by. Hundreds of thousands were fired or furloughed from their jobs, and of those who remained working on the front lines, many fell sick from contact with the virus at work.With no safety nets in place, cooks emerged from the wreckage to build their own independent, makeshift businesses, redirecting their skills as fine-dining cooks, or their connections to purveyors and farmers, to new projects. It’s exciting, but precarious.In May, Erik Piedrahita, formerly the executive sous-chef at Bon Temps in Los Angeles, constructed a brick oven and grill in his father’s backyard, a few miles from Griffith Park, the pickup location. Diners who placed orders via Instagram would wait for their orders and picnic, or drive the food home.“I don’t have any formal training in barbecue whatsoever,” said Mr. Piedrahita, who started the Neighborhood Barbecue last spring on Instagram, and recently switched from taking orders through his direct messages to Tock. “But I took the knowledge I have from restaurants and tried to apply it to barbecue.”Mr. Piedrahita, 33, buys meat from the same purveyors he did at Bon Temps. He brines and grills about 60 pounds of short ribs and 20 pounds of chicken a week, cooking them over fire, or more slowly over embers, and consistently sells out. The chicken this past weekend was dark and sticky, smoky and succulent.Still, at least twice in the past months, he has considered giving up on the project entirely.Though Mr. Piedrahita has visited restaurant auctions over the months to get deals on stainless steel prep tables, a powerful Vitamix and other equipment, he doesn’t have the refrigeration required for a larger operation. Most home kitchens don’t.“I basically have a cloud kitchen at my dad’s house,” he said. “And in order to make it really financially viable, we’d have to expand to sell on more days.”Without more refrigeration, that’s not possible, but forces of circumstance have changed his work-life balance and temporarily reshaped his ambitions. “I miss restaurants, but right now I get to see my dad every day,” Mr. Piedrahita said. “I have time to live a life, and not just be in the kitchen from dawn to dusk.”On a busy weekend, Kevin Hockin sells about 600 thin-crusted, lightly charred pizzas through a gap in his fence, at home in Altadena, Calif. Side Pie is a small operation, but even if there were room to grow, Mr. Hockin thinks 1,000 pizzas a weekend probably would be the limit, for now.“This pandemic has opened our eyes to how things need to change going forward, forever,” he said. “Everyone in the industry was used to working themselves to death and now, everyone’s rethinking it.”After closing Collage Coffee in March, and putting construction of his new restaurant in Altadena on hold, Mr. Hockin worked on his pizza technique with Irfan Zaidi, formerly of Roberta’s.He posted photos of pizzas, and chihuahuas in cute hats, on Instagram, and quickly developed a small but devoted fan base for the pies.Mr. Hockin, 38, designed tie-dye merchandise to sell. Ms. Piligian, a former pastry chef at Sqirl, baked seasonal slab pies for him to sell for dessert. But after a neighbor repeatedly called the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to complain, the operation shut down — temporarily.Mr. Hockin reopened his coffee shop and is waiting for permitting at his restaurant space, so he can operate Side Pie legally. “It’s a total jam-up,” he said. “But I have to use this bootleg pizza operation out of my yard to cover the losses of my coffee shop and pay my employees.”For cooks who don’t have the social-media savvy to promote their businesses on Instagram, or for immigrant cooks who might not be fluent in English, managing the writing, marketing and unexpected hiccups of customer service through direct messages can be a challenge.Sophia Parsa, 29, collaborates with her mother, Farah Parsa, 62, and helps to package and translate her Persian home cooking to social media. It’s an essential part of their business, Golden Rice, which currently does pickups at the West Hollywood club Bootsy Bellows.The women cooked their first pop-up in their home kitchen in Los Angeles last July, posting details on Instagram and inverting about 40 domes of Iranian-style rice with shiny, crisp bottoms into delivery boxes.The tahdigs were piled with tiny, tangy barberries and came with mast, a thick, creamy yogurt with herbs. Their food has become so popular since that the Parsas have added three more cooks and two drivers to their team, and graduated from four plug-in stoves to more equipment.Expansion is promising, but for many cooks finding success in the margins of the restaurant industry right now, it’s hard to sit back and enjoy it.“It’s just weird to feel so excited about this at a time when restaurants are taking such a hit,” said Ms. Parsa about the growth of Golden Rice. “They’re all tied in leases and things they can’t get out of, and it’s a giant mess.”Ms. Parsa worked previously as the head of community for an education start-up, but most of her new hires are cooks who were let go from their restaurant jobs during the pandemic. They’re the ones helping the pop-up scene grow.“We’re not tied to anything right now,” she said. “We’re able to stay lean and that’s what makes it possible to do what we’re doing.”Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

	<title>Sarah Huckabee Sanders Is Running for Office. Will Other Trump Allies Follow?</title>
	<author>Annie Karni</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary under former President Donald J. Trump, announced Monday that she was running for governor in Arkansas, her home state, competing for a seat once held by her father.“I took on the media, the radical left and their cancel culture, and I won,” Ms. Sanders, 38, said in a nearly eight-minute video, signaling that she planned to frame herself not as a policy-driven candidate but as a vessel for Republican rage, in a test of the endurance of Mr. Trump’s grievance politics.Ms. Sanders, who was encouraged by Mr. Trump to run when she left the White House in 2019 and had long planned her announcement, is one of several former Trump officials and family members whose names have been floated for political races of their own. But as of now, she appears to be alone in hatching firm plans for a campaign after Mr. Trump’s defeat.Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, is in the process of moving to Florida, where there had been talk of a potential primary challenge to Senator Marco Rubio, her onetime partner on a child care tax credit. While she is not ruling anything out, she is unlikely to seek office.While her sister-in-law, Lara Trump, had been eyeing an open Senate seat in North Carolina, her home state, in 2022, it is now less clear if she will enter the race.Vice President Mike Pence is still wondering if he can carry the Trump mantle in a Republican presidential primary in 2024, a gambit that would depend on Mr. Trump’s choosing not to run or being convicted in the coming Senate impeachment trial.Ms. Sanders may be a unique case study. She is stepping over both the Arkansas lieutenant governor and the state attorney general, who waited their turn and supported Mr. Trump but who can’t claim as close a connection to him as Ms. Sanders can. Mr. Trump was expected to endorse her on Monday night, an adviser to the former president said. She also has powerful family connections in the deep-red state, where the only race that really matters is the Republican primary.“The Republican base is not interested in serious governing candidates,” said Tim Miller, who served as an adviser to former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. “They want people who will ‘own the libs,’ and Sarah is perfect for that.”While a grievance-first strategy may be ruinous to the party’s chances in swing states like Pennsylvania and Virginia, it resonates in a conservative state like Arkansas. “Pro-coup Trumpism is a meal ticket to success in a Republican primary,” Mr. Miller said.Ms. Sanders has already started to build a statewide operation, and because of her father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, she has high name recognition and a political identity in Arkansas beyond an association with Mr. Trump.Here are other Trump officials and family members who have been seen as possible contenders for higher office, but who may face a more difficult path.Ms. Trump, 38, the president’s daughter-in-law, who emerged during the 2020 presidential campaign as a fierce defender of Mr. Trump, has been eyeing an electoral future of her own in North Carolina, her home state. She and her husband, Eric Trump, have yet to relocate their family from New York, but in the months leading up to the presidential election, she had been actively considering a rare Senate seat that will open there in 2022, when Senator Richard Burr retires at the end of his term, people familiar with her plans said.Ms. Trump’s combativeness was seen as potentially appealing to Republican primary voters. During the 2020 campaign, she went where Ivanka Trump would not: repeating Mr. Trump’s ad hominem attacks on Hunter Biden and casting doubt on the integrity of the election. Political strategists have compared her to Kelly Loeffler, the recently defeated Georgia senator, but say that she has more skill on the campaign trail.The upsides of a Lara Trump candidacy were that she would immediately have more name recognition and an ability to raise cash online that would most likely dwarf that of the more experienced Republicans in the race. Her last name already prompted Mark Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina who served as Mr. Trump’s final White House chief of staff, to say publicly that he would not run for Senate in the state, a race that his advisers had expected him to consider.But since Mr. Trump’s defeat, it is less clear whether his daughter-in-law will enter the race, perhaps a concession to the fact that simply aligning herself with the former president to win the Republican primary would not gird her for the potential backlash in a general election in a swing state.In October, when Ivanka Trump described herself as “pro-life, and unapologetically so,” her comment was seen as the surest sign to date that the ambitious, spotlight-seeking Trump daughter was serious about a career of her own in Republican politics.Over the past four years, Ms. Trump, 39, has undergone a political transformation, from a registered New York Democrat to what she has described as a “proud Trump Republican.” During the 2020 campaign, she was considered by Trump campaign officials to be the top surrogate for her father, often speaking on his behalf to suburban women. For years, she has promoted articles and had her staff pitch stories about how she rivaled top Democratic presidential candidates in her fund-raising abilities.She is still packing up her mansion in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, but will relocate in the coming weeks to Florida, where her advisers say she is weighing her options when it comes to elected office. That includes not popping a trial balloon about a potential primary challenge next year to Mr. Rubio, who Republican critics note could be vulnerable because he did not vote to sustain any objections to the state’s electors.Other observers have dismissed that scenario as a difficult way to begin a political career and said Mr. Rubio needed to take it less seriously after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. Running for state office is off the table for Ms. Trump because Florida law requires seven years of residency. Some people who know her say that her ambitions are higher, that she likes the ring of “first female president” and that there’s simply no downside to keeping her name afloat.She has surprising allies promoting it for her. “Ivanka would be a terrific candidate, with her presence, grace and beauty,” said Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist who received a pardon from Mr. Trump. Once an enemy of Ms. Trump’s in the White House, he is now intent on propping her up. “She’s also the most populist because she’s fully focused on working families,” he said.“From Huckabee to Lara Trump to Don Jr. to Kayleigh McEnany, this is the new vanguard of the MAGA movement,” Mr. Bannon added. “I anticipate these people will be either running in 2022 or 2024.”Ms. McEnany, for her part, has already relocated to her home state, Florida, and there was briefly some talk of her mounting her own bid for the Senate, a person familiar with those conversations said. But it’s not clear how serious it was.Over the past four years, Donald Trump Jr., 43, the president’s eldest son, has carved out a political lane for himself as a top surrogate and fund-raiser who can channel the emotional center of the MAGA movement. With 11 million followers on his various social media streams, he has been seen as a key player in the Republican messaging ecosystem, someone with a strong connection to his father’s supporters and to conservative voters who are passionate about the Second Amendment.His advisers insist that he’s not interested in being a candidate anytime in the near future — partly because there is not a clear office for him to run for right now. That hasn’t stopped strategists from floating his name as a potential candidate in states including Montana and Florida. For now, the advisers said, he wants to stay engaged and relevant politically, along with his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, helping to elect conservatives he likes and to take down the ones he doesn’t.On Monday he tweeted an article from The Federalist, a right-wing publication, that called for Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming to “Step Away From Leadership For GOP Voters.” He also vowed to help Ms. Sanders win her race.Mr. Meadows, 61, has told people he has ruled out running for office again. But his friends and his own wife don’t believe him, or don’t want to. Others say they haven’t been able to get a straight answer out of him about his future plans. During his tenure in the White House, Mr. Meadows, the former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, competed with Vice President Mike Pence to be seen as the heir to the president’s agenda and as Mr. Trump’s right hand. He even slept at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center when the president was being treated there for the coronavirus.Mr. Meadows still lives in Washington and has no immediate plans to move back to North Carolina, his home state. His wife has speculated that he should run for president in 2024, according to people familiar with those conversations. But his friends have not ruled out a future run for Senate or governor in North Carolina, and Ms. Trump’s fading interest in the North Carolina Senate race could give him back an opening.</body>

	<title>Biden Names His Personal Doctor, Kevin O’Connor, to Be White House Physician</title>
	<author>Thomas Kaplan</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — President Biden has selected his longtime physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, to serve as his doctor in the White House, an official said on Monday.Dr. O’Connor, a retired Army colonel, succeeds Dr. Sean P. Conley in a role that drew unusual scrutiny during President Donald J. Trump’s administration amid accusations that he and his predecessor had exaggerated Mr. Trump’s health.At 78, Mr. Biden is the oldest president in United States history. His selection of Dr. O’Connor brings aboard a doctor with whom he has a longstanding personal relationship.Dr. O’Connor was the physician to Mr. Biden when he was vice president and continued to serve as his physician after he left office. “He’s never asked me if I am a Republican or a Democrat,” Dr. O’Connor once said of Mr. Biden.An osteopathic physician, Dr. O’Connor began serving as a doctor at the White House in 2006, when President George W. Bush was in office.In December 2019, Mr. Biden’s campaign released a three-page memo from Dr. O’Connor in which he described Mr. Biden as “healthy” and “vigorous,” adding that he was “fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency, to include those as chief executive, head of state and commander in chief.”Three decades earlier, Mr. Biden, then a senator from Delaware, had a life-threatening health scare. In 1988, just months after ending his first presidential bid, he had emergency surgery for a brain aneurysm. He had another operation months later for a second brain aneurysm and returned to the Senate that year after a lengthy absence. Dr. O’Connor wrote in his 2019 memo that Mr. Biden “has never had any recurrences of any aneurysms.”More recently, after Mr. Biden’s election in November, Dr. O’Connor provided information about Mr. Biden’s condition after he slipped while playing with one of his dogs and fractured his foot.Dr. O’Connor’s hiring was reported earlier on Monday by ABC News. His predecessor, Dr. Conley, was thrust in the spotlight after Mr. Trump announced in early October that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and was subsequently hospitalized. But Dr. Conley quickly drew criticism for making misleading comments about Mr. Trump’s condition; one infectious disease expert described him as “a spin doctor, not a medical doctor,” and Dr. Conley admitted that he had sought to “reflect the upbeat attitude” of Mr. Trump.Dr. Conley is being reassigned in the Navy, according to the official who confirmed Dr. O’Connor’s hiring.Dr. Conley succeeded Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, who had spoken in glowing terms about Mr. Trump’s health. He declared in 2018 that the former president had “incredible genes” and said, “I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old.”Later that year, Mr. Trump nominated Dr. Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Dr. Jackson withdrew from consideration after accusations of inappropriate workplace behavior, and Mr. Trump later named him as his chief medical adviser.Dr. Jackson is now serving in Washington in a different capacity: as a member of Congress. In November, he was elected to the House as a Republican from Texas.</body>
